0,I am a data scientist with two years of experience. I figured some people might get some from my experience so here it goes.   I graduated from NYU with a degree in finance and applied to about 5 jobs to start with. A lot of them were actually Finance jobs at Fidelity  Morgan Stanley  JP Morgan  Mellon and then the company I work with.   The jobs available at Fidelity and Mellon were not really entry level  so it didn’t surprise me that I did not get those jobs.   I did get a job at Morgan Stanley  JP Morgan and my current company. I rejected the former two and accepted the latter because they had an office close to my parents house  which was a benefit for someone just starting out and because it was a general data scientist position rather than more of a financial analyst position.  At that point I had a background in Stats  Calc and R through coursework in high school and uni and I had a calendar year of experience doing research in a financial sector and several months as a Psychology RA. I understood all of the common types of models (Linear Regression  KNN  Time Series etc.) very well and I had applied them.   During my first year at work I mostly supported research projects. My local office didn’t have another data scientist (they still don’t) and I had to build the capability from the ground up. This involved a lot of research as well as meeting people where they were. Many of the people I was working with were still hand entering data into a spreadsheet and then painstakingly hand jamming graphs. I supported these employees by teaching them how to build better spreadsheets for analytics  automating processes in spreadsheets by teaching myself VBA and helping the business/financial etc. analysts understand what kind of things would prevent fully a fully automated process. There were some business cases that involved some simple modeling  but nothing too crazy.   During this time I also took a graduate course in Python that covered all of the basic statistical techniques (LR  KNN Time Series etc.) using my education benefit. I was bored  so the professor sent me more advanced materials. I learned more about Neural Networks  SMOTE and other techniques.  The first 1/2 of my second year I worked mostly with visualizations. I had helped my colleagues get their spreadsheets into a more usable format and automated some of the data pulls (not all of the data systems are hosted on a server that can be attached to a viz tool~ modernization is still in progress). Before the end of my first year there had been some “dashboards” but they mostly consisted of slapping graphs onto a tableau dashboard all over creation. Some departments did not have the budget/ leadership backing for Tableau so we stuck to automated spreadsheets  but for the departments that did have the budget and the support I created dashboards that were well thought out  had purpose  flowed  included various features to make them extremely easy to use and I made that the standard for 
1,Meh  this episode was pretty lame and I can't imagine 11 more episodes of this already tired gig being very interesting. A student literally can't swim to the point of drowning himself if submerged  but the teacher forces him to traverse a log over water (what about teaching him to swim maybe). Even right after being seen by a mysterious student that 'blinks' away  at a time where she doesn't yet know about his ability  she still decides to throw the guy off a cliff? The last thing you want right before murdering is a witness  and somehow the timeline doesn't change at all. And the way they don't question her vague 'mind reads'  surely if she claimed to hear someone elses voice being real impostery you'd wanna know all about what it said.  It feels like this anime is trying to go really big brain but it just falls flat. After this episode i hate all the characters and also the plot.
2,"I run a fantasy campaign where character advancement is tracked by the players performing achievements (video game style)  and I've just had a player roll up a monster hunter. Didn't have any achievements for that archetype yet  so I've been working on that today. While I've cooked up the prerequisite amount  some of them seemed a bit lackluster.  So  I thought I might try the internet hivemind. What are some archetypical things for a monster hunter to do?  Among already listed achievements  in no particular order  I've got ""Collect a bounty on a monster""  ""Kill a monster regarded as a deity""  ""Pick up local rumors""  ""Track a creature through the wilderness""  ""Climb a monster""  ""Gain the aid of multiple allies in a monster hunt""  ""Save a village from a monster""  and a bunch of ""Hunt and defeat a magical beast""  ""Hunt and defeat a troll""  ""Hunt and defeat a vampire"" and so on.   Plenty more  but the above very the most monster huntery  and I'd like more of that. Definitely want them short and sweet like above  and multi-stage achievements (""Kill 10 bats"") is NOT something I work with."
3,Did you make sure the colour depth was set to 10bit in your nvidia control panel? Sounds like an easy question but you don't seem to have mentioned it anywhere.  edit: If you're saying you've set it to 10bit and the panel is still doing 4:2:2 then it's clearly a software issue. The CX can do full 4:4:4 at 4k120 10bit  literally the panel's default specification. I'd caution against drawing some wider significance from this before we find out what the specific issue is. You're lamenting the death of large format OLED displays for PC gaming before you even know what the real problem might be.
4,For comparison  here's the useable space on the Xbox One for different drive sizes.  * (a) 500GB Standard (365GB)    (779MB Unallocated)  * (b) 1TB Standard   (781GB)  (50.51GB Unallocated)  * (c) 2TB Standard  (1662GB) (101.02GB Unallocated)
5,The biggest feature the TLX and RDX are missing was an all digital dash. GOod thing acura is doing it with the MDX  hopefully that trickles down to the other two models with a refresh.   Another thing to notice is that there was a power meter on the dash  not RPMs. This probably indicates a hybrid  probably a Sports Hybrid All Wheel Drive layout (like the RLX and previous gen MDX where there are two electric motors in the rear axle and ICE in the front)  however i'm hoping this version offers all electric range or there's a plug-in hybrid option.   Also excited to see massage seats in the MDX (is that an Acura first?). This may be a pointer at Acura trying to move upmarket while offering similar value as before  a la Genesis.
6,"I will never defend crunch time but the media do tend to jump on the band wagon for other topics too. One developer said in passing that the game would be slightly shorter than The Witcher 3 given that not many people completed that campaign. Suddenly every news outlet and their mum was screaming ""Cyberpunk Short than the Witcher!"" ""Cyberpunk Shortened"". So I agree that there is a weird narrative against them but also you cannot possibly defend crunch after specifically saying you wouldn't do it."
7,At a time of global pandemic and equal financial crisis  the rich have so much that Mercedes has decided in just a few years to abandon course for a lower market grab (see CLA) and focus even **further** up market.  Think about that. It makes me want to cry.  Edit: I'm outside the local bar and just saw a stock Datsun 240 go by. My mood has increased
8,"I'd also like to add the thought of ""Well I don't want to learn with a specific engine  and then find out later that I can't use that engine for what I want to do."" Meaning I don't want to accidentally waste more time than necessary.  That and constantly looking up various games that I love and seeing what engine/no engine they used and still being unsure!"
9,"A few that I haven't seen mentioned yet:  Mothership - OSR inspired space horror game with great modules. Different enough from Traveller that it seems worth mentioning. I find it very charming for some reason.  Pendragon - To be fair I've never played it  but just reading it was pretty interesting. The time scale for the game is very long  with one main event per year which gives it a different feel most other games. Lots of medieval lore embedded in the rules too which is pretty interesting.   Some older indie games worth checking out:  Psi*Run - I love running this game as a one shot. Very cool central mechanic that I've never seen anywhere else. The theme is amnesiac people with psychic powers running away from evil agents and trying to regain their memories  more or less.  Trollbabe - An action adventure game with a totally different way of prepping adventures than what I had been used to. Focuses a lot on what player characters are willing to stake their lives on. Honestly the writing in the book can be hard to parse sometimes but I think it's totally worth it. It ended up inspiring lasers and feelings  and some would say Dogs in the Vineyard as well.  The Shadow of Yesterday - Another fantasy adventure game with some very unique mechanics. I think my favorite part of it is that part of character creation is selecting ""keys"" which determine what types of actions your character receives xp for. Never had a chance to play this one  but it definitely felt worth the read  at least the first few chapters."
10,Sambas and Westfalias are in really high demand among collectors. From there  supply and demand. The number that aren't piles of rust is getting smaller. Especially those that weren't restored or rustored  since collectors tend to prefer original examples.
11,So is there a list somewhere of which cards have which configuration? Or is it too early to say because there aren't enough in the wild and supposedly the ones sent to reviewers may not be exactly the same as production units?

13,I liked to wear the traveler or ronin outfits most of the game but wearing the traveler outfit would sense artifacts which would then vibrate on the controller without any real direction as to where the artifact is was MADDENING.
14,R using the Tidyverse is likely the easiest approach. The 'mental' process is a bit more similar to SAS so it's less of a stretch mentally.   I switched over a  few years ago and after about 3 months it was all good.l
15,I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza I bought used with a rebuilt title  but it did not have any engine damage. I lost my only key and had no luck with a locksmith because apparently they have encrypted coding in their keys beyond certain years or something. I was in a remote area so with limited options outside of that one locksmith  I had to tow it to a Subaru dealership to have the key replaced.   The folks at the dealership said the year of the vehicle was kind of on the border of this coding change and kept going back and forth on whether they could get a key made immediately or if they’d have to remove parts of the ignition system of my car and send them in to be cleared and recoded with the new key. They ended up doing the latter.   Apparently when the dealership got the parts back a note was included saying that since it has a rebuilt title there’s additional parts and work involved. That added an extra thousand dollars onto the bill. Reminder  as far as I know (and I’m pretty sure I can find documentation on it) the rebuilt title was due to a fender bender type situation with no parts of the engine damaged/replaced.   I don’t know enough about cars and that’s probably obvious to the Subaru people so my alarm bells are going off like crazy that they’re trying to pull one over on me. My brother told me he was able to replace a key for a 2016 Subaru Legacy by procuring a key from eBay or something and having a locksmith code it. Why would my car be any different? I don’t trust what they’re telling me at all and it kinda feels like they’re holding my car for ransom at this point.   I’m planning on talking to other dealerships and maybe even other locksmiths in the morning for additional opinions and ideas that I might be able to talk them down with. Or maybe I should just try to trade it in? Any advice on what else I need to say or find out to  get out of this relatively unscathed? It’s been an unbelievable ordeal already.
16,Breaks my heart to hear about the people who make an industry I love and passionate for being treated like shit. You should take this to the press  anonymously of course.   It's about time Ubisoft were understood as the company they are.
17,First Timer  I’m glad Miyata and Ippo are looking like they’ll be friends - not just rivals. Having that mutual respect and pushing each other to be better - rather than being petty and hating each other. Miyata mentioned it  why would he leave the gym over something so small.  I wasn’t so sure about the coach the first couple episodes  he almost seemed to have a not so great mentality  but I like him a lot now  and I love how proud of Ippo he gets.   I love a good training montage  and the one at the end of episode 5 was great also  going along with the OP. I wasn’t loving the OP at first  but now I’m starting to really like it.  I wonder if we’ll be getting some backstory on his dad.   I was wondering when the girl from the OP was going to show up  and we got a glimpse of her!  The fight was great  and that reporter must have felt so lucky. He goes to interview Miyata  and discovers that there is another potential great boxer. I wonder if Ippo will start to get some recognition around school or something  assuming he is given a bigger spotlight in the article since he won.   Questions:  1. He probably respects Ippo a little more now.  2. It was great. Miyata treating him like an equal boxer  instead of a rookie. Makes sense  after how hard Ippo trained recently. And the coach thinking Ippo reached his breaking point  that he was happy with how he fought  but Ippo saying he still had something left in the tank and something else to try that he worked on on his own. Seeing all the techniques and counters was cool as well.  3. I think the coach is a bigger tsundere.
18,I used to get awful anxiety before running a game but my way to beat it is to:  1st - have someone in the group so the recap as best they can from last week.  2nd - have a paragraph of pre written content that I read through to set the scene and get me over my jitters. It doesn't have to be especially long and should be written in a way that's not way more flowery than ones normal mode of speaking.  I know that once we're Into it I can improv and rp perfectly well  but I need that gentle on ramp to get me over the jitters.
19,"Typo on last path for Ian:  > Not only that  the new Xe-LP graphics seem **exiting**  and warrant a closer inspection.  Unless it was intended :).  Interesting review. Seems like this series is strictly for power efficiency gains on mobile  but no IPC improvements. I guess the gpu is ""something"". Nobody should feel bad buying a 10th gen series after seeing 11th gen. And you'd feel damn right good buying a Renoir in a nice chassis."
20,I make all kinds of great NPCs and villains with complex motivations and I can’t bring most of them to life or follow through. I can’t do memorable voices so they know who’s talking. When an NPC comes along for part of the adventure because they love them or they’ll add something to a sequence I tend to forget they’re there. I can’t remember to add dialogue once we start combats. I love my stories but I need to keep the characters in my brain and bring them to life better.
21,Oftentimes  there is the Big Bad  the main threat or obstacles for our protagonists to defeat. But  woven throughout a narrative  there are other villains who come to fight the protagonists and they deserve some respect  which this thread is meant to do.  Note: Big Bads who get demoted  non-main villains that become the Big Bad  and villians who turn out to be secretly good the whole time are not eligable. Good guys who turn bad and stay bad are eligable.
22,"Basically a tenured professor at a top university can earn 200-300k. Full freedom to do whatever the fuck you want  your own team  your own labs  you get paid to sit on a committee somewhere etc. A lot of perks and benefits in other words.  To poach people of that caliber  they need to basically double/triple it. I wouldn't be surprised that some top data scientist or researcher could earn a few million per year total compensation (600-700k salary and rest is stocks  retirement fund match etc).  They're ""data scientists"" just like Jeff Dean is a ""software engineer""."
23, I've always looked down my nose at SAS but now I may pick it up again for one feature: its ability to easily query local files with SQL and efficiently join with tables in a database. With Proc SQL  I can join local files with database tables as if they were both in the database and cleanly have the result in local memory.  By comparison  Python and R dataframes must be queried with their own functions and syntax (numpy  pandas  tidyverse  etc) and joining with database tables involves either downloading the whole table / querying for a piece of it and loading it local memory  or writing a table definition and uploading the dataframe into the database. When uploading a data file into the database  SAS can even automatically generate column names and data types.  To me  SAS seems like the superior analytical tool for ease of use when the job requires lots of SQL and munging. Though I would love to be proved wrong here.
24,6000 series benchmark scores between 3070 and 3080 in performance based on the 3 games shown (Borderlands 3  Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Gears of War 5).  I guess what matters is the price - they can take the mid-high end market with the right price... and probably win over some impatient gamers that want that 3080 level performance.  Also  the ram matters... so it could be a repeat of the Ryzen 3 - most of the gaming performance  but better producitivity performance  and a better price.
25,I don't recruit players anymore.  I built my groups years ago from friend groups  so we just play whatever.  That being said - I've heard it's very difficult  but some subreddits have communities that are about it.  I know r/shadowrun has something.
26,If you're using RPG sessions as a cheap stand-in for another hobby  stop it and just make that other hobby happen.  Also  stop thinking up a million and one possible projects  and just focus on getting one to the table.

30,How many other data scientists does the company have?  What are they doing?  Do they have reading groups?  Do they do presentations for the other data scientists?  All of these activities will help you learn new techniques and concepts.  As for technology  you're right  a big company probably won't expose you to a lot of new technologies.  But it'll likely have processes and documentation for using their existing technologies  from which you'll learn best practices.  Those best practices will guide you well if you eventually decide to join a startup.

32,Unity is pretty far ahead for simulation/tycoon games IMO. Firstly because it makes the UI part easy  and UI is a pretty big part of those games. Also they're code heavy  so you really want C# to get it done in a reasonable amount of time.
33,Financially  it makes no sense. IP-wise it makes the most sense.  Nvidia's CPU team failed in bringing anything remotely competitive in years  and Arm has an incredibly aggressive CPU roadmap in the next few years.   Nvidia would be betting on doubling down and strengthening Arm R&D in order to directly attack Intel & AMD in the datecentre  and ensure the long-term dominance there in a few years.   The question is what will happen to the licensees - Ampere  Amazon and the rest are probably shitting their pants right now as to what Nvidia plans to do here. Financially  it makes little sense to strengthen or enable these licensees as that's just continuing Arm's current business model which while that works by itself with Arm as an independent company  cannot give the ROI on the sky-high purchase  price  and is reason as to why SoftBank wants to get rid of Arm in the first place.  Nvidia has the ecosystem by the balls if they buy Arm - maybe that's enough strategic value for them to ignore the short-term non-gains of such a purchase.
34,"**Rewatcher  sub  book reader**  Once again  the narrator makes it sound like the Count's long-term plans for Albert are nefarious.  ""The Letter from Edmond"" Oh this should be good *insert popcorn.GIF*  Wait  is this funeral for Barrois  or Valentine  or both!? Ok I guess Valentine survived.  Maximilien wants to take Valentine to Marseilles but Gerard interferes and tells them to GTFO.  That ""priest"" looks awfully similar to Luigi Vampa ... he even has the scar over one eye and an eyepatch (from the Count stabbing his eye?).  Gerard has quite the look on his face when he reads ""Dantes""!!  So Gerard is a shitty father to all his kids.  Edouard stopped crying as soon as Gerard left? This reminds me of someone I used to know  and not in a good way.  Cavalcanti is reeling in Danglars by dangling his supposed inheritance of land and riches. ""Partner"" my ass!  Danglars tells Cavalcanti there's a scandal starting to brew around the Morcerf family? First I'm hearing of this! Count?  The letter for Fernand  does it say ""One Microsoft Way"" at the bottom left? That's really jarring ...  The papers Fernand are reading mention Janina  Haydée  and Fernand Mondego! I can't read French but I might try Google Translate. This is probably the scandal Danglars mentioned  triggered by the incident at the opera house?  Fernand has a Chekov Gun in his desk drawer?  ""no right to throw someone's house into turmoil"" This may have passed in the 1800s  but I would hope that in the 5000s they'd be a little more concerned about Valentine being poisoned.  Mercedes reacts to Edmond's letter as well! Is the letter claiming that Edmond died?  Albert follows his father? And Teresa  Luigi Vampa's mistress is there too?  Morcerf  Villefort  Danglars  and I guess Caderousse  are these the targets of Edmond's vengeance?  BOVILLE is dead in the coffin?  Edouard is being a little shit knocking down the vases  but I have to say  that fits him perfectly.  Franz  Renaud and Maximilien are smuggling Valentine out while her father's away.  So Noirtier can only move his eyes and that one finger? But he manages to out Heloise as the poisoner!  And now Noirtier really did fall out of his wheelchair?  Heloise and Edouard attempt to stop the crew from taking Valentine.  We see Boville investigating a house  probably Louis Dantes's?  So the priest wasn't Luigi Vampa  it was the Count *cosplaying* as Luigi Vampa?  Gerard has a gun too?  Aw come on  you can't leave off *there* ..."
35,When I'm evaluating any new tabletop system (or MMO) I like to immediately look at their rogue classes. If they are focused on DPS and combat rather than thievery  spying  smuggling  subterfuge  and the like I have little-to-no interest in the game.     It might not be what you're looking for  but my favorite system has been the second edition of Warhammer Fantasy Role-Playing Game. Classes are replaced with careers  which are setting-appropriate and not focused entirely on combat. There are rules for crafting  trade  and other non-combat activities. My favorite campaign was based around a street gang in Marionburg that eventually ran a tavern with a fencing/smuggling operation in the basement.

37,**Caliban**  The realm of the dead. Not literally  but it might as well be. Here there is endless battle. At the heart of the system the red planet is a battlefield threatening to explode. Desperately surrounded by quarantine systems and killer tech  preventing everything from entering or leaving. Everything except the Crusader Cadre  the heroes of Guild propaganda who defend against the threat barely contained on the surface. The Warkind.  The product of terrible science  the Warphage. It warps both flesh - living or necrotic - and machine. What results is a horrible unstoppable endless rearming synergy: the Warkind. They know one thought: destruction. There is no cure  despite the best efforts of the Imperium  and subsequently  the Guild. It must be contained  if left unchecked it would destroy civilisation.  The Warphage dates back thousands of years to the age of the Solar Barons  created by one to defeat others subsequently out of control. Some believe it was created with the help of arcane power. No one really knows  not even the Cabal. It is as much a threat to them as all else. Despite that  and the agreement among all that it should be dealt with  there remain those foolish enough to think they can exploit it. Or those that think they can profit from efforts to contain it.  They are wrong.   **Crusaders**   Brave heroes of Caliban. The Cadre is the current iteration of the great Crusader Knights of the wars that formed the Imperium. Once they were legendary  seated beside the Warfather during the Imperium’s founding. Now  on Caliban  they can expect to last no more than twenty days. But their achievements echo throughout eternity in the Cadre’s cloisters. Their families enjoy honour and privilege  if not Sols. Most do not have a family.   Some Crusaders escape  denying this dubious honour (some also survive to become great heroes often as elites or the castellans of Haloheim). Those few who escape Cloak’s purges are forever deemed traitors  but there’s no shortage of work or opportunity  in places like Port Cruach  for their skills. They are often called the Fallen. A jibe if nothing else. Bounty Hunters can profit from chasing them down  and such exploits  like the exploits of more honourable Crusaders (genuine twenty dayers) make for excellent broadcast propaganda.  Some Crusaders are given leave by the Cloister of Blades to work elsewhere. This must be done in secret as it would be a shame to deny one the chance to fight on Caliban. However sometimes needs must  and the Crusaders fight on many fronts.   The Cloister  once stationed in Haloheim with honour  has long since relocated to Caliban  occupying the only surviving spaceport in the capital. A once thriving city that is now a struggling bulwark: Olympus Redoubt. It has a population  but they are functionaries and ancillary staff. They also include agents of the black market. Thogh the Guild frowns on this  it dare not risk the security of the Crusader effort. Besides the market i
38,This made me tear up. My dad had this awesome 280z back in the day but he sold it after having me. What sucks though is how expensive they are these days and the fact I'm only 21 making next to nothing and he is 63 means I probally wont get to do this for him.
39,From what I've seen  it's mainly three things:  1. The villain's identity being way too obvious (I agree with this one)  2. The rooftop confrontation being handled better in the manga (haven't read the manga  thought the scene was kind of meh  but I didn't hate it)  3. The MC not getting together with Kayo in the end (I didn't mind it)  Edit: got some names confused
40,Goldilock One is a third person action RPG  using a mix of hack and slash and strategy combat  co-op puzzles and sandbox elements for the level design. The player may choose one out of three characters to start the game. The progress will be mostly based on having fun with the hack and slash combat  to grind  explore and get stronger  but it will also have strategic combats  with dashes of suspense  where the player must correctly manage his skills and resources.    Lore    The game is set in the 121th century. By the 22nd century humans caused the climatic conditions that other beings needed to invade planet Earth. We tried fighting them  but had to abandon our home planet.  The survivors set their course to Goldilock One  a far away planet that was “just right”  and able to sustain life. This planet has a synchronous rotation and translation movements around its own star  making one of its faces always illuminated and heated  and the other hidden  always cold and in the shadows.  The first settlers established themselves in the circumference perpendicular to the axis which separates the poles  in the central region of the planet  that became the Royal Ring. Due to their own differences  they decided to be divided and isolated in five kingdoms  developing their own culture and way of life. After many years  due to different interactions in the new planet  each kingdom evolved differently than the other  resulting in new different races and ethnicities.  Each kingdom deemed their way of life as right and all others were wrong. Each race  possessed by a belief of superiority  thought they were better than the others  and must remain pure. Those who are born from a mix of races are known as the “badborns”  people who have a clear phenotypic difference and are thought to be lesser than all other races. Badborns are only able to live among the pure races as their vassals. They must obey their law  or be exiled to Nebegarde  the cold and dark side of Goldilock One.    The Game    You have been exiled to Nebegarde  the cold and dark side of the Goldilock One planet  where you will face the badborn reality. Your main concern is to survive. You must fight your way through their harsh reality  become stronger  and try to get back to the Royal Section  on your way you're going to face an unfair and complex system. You can challenge it or use it for your own advantage.  Pick up one of the Heroes and start your Journey. The other two heroes you didn’t choose will be available for you to use in co-op experiences  which will depend on the decisions you take. You can accept them or not  and it may change your way of progressing and experience.  Character progression mechanics are similar to some other RPG’s  such as: base attributes  skill tree  inventory  item collecting and equipping  quest system  etc. The level design is net based  player actions will affect the level background parameters  which will make all the level respond to the actions  using NPCs be
41,Can confirm. BMW V6  400v battery. Less HP  more torque. Completely new carbon tub. Modern safety systems available too.  Edit  Some act surprised it's a BMW engine  not realising the V8 is essentially a Nissan engine...  Edit 2  I used to work for McLaren Automotive until two months ago and have built the upcoming model. BMW DOES make V6 engines. They're just not used in their road cars. They also currently make V12s so it's not really a shock.
42,"So  skills are not representative of every single thing that a character can *do* unless the ruleset you're playing in says otherwise. Often these are ""trained only"" things like picking locks.  The more important thing to practice is not calling for rolls that are not truly being **tested** in the moment you roll. If the outcome wouldn't matter whether you succeeded or failed in that moment  you shouldn't roll. Knowledge is the most difficult type to apply this rationale to.   The reason for this angle is that people living in the worlds you're likely to depict may know a lot of things  but not at a scholarly level. Knowing a lot of things about the religions and gods of the world may be relevant to people with access to information and oral tradition  or it may not be  if they're more intellectually closed. Those distinctions are more arbitrary than you may think and have more to do with your own worldbuilding than they do a flat response of needing a skill to know them.  How do you deal with it? Practice. Players can only learn in so many ways. You can come up with analogies and try to really drive home the concept of IC and OOC  which are dead simple  but if it still eludes them  the most you can do is keep trying.   For my part  I think of characters as an Author does. A reader would be justifiably annoyed if the characters in their book kept using information from the antagonist chapters to thwart them  having done nothing to gain that knowledge. It's not different for them in a TTRPG  at all."
43,I’m currently in my second year of B.S. Statistics with concentration in Statistical Computing and am looking for internships.  I am studying R and C++ in school  along with Calc 3 / Stats classes and taking Linear Algebra next quarter.   On my own I learn and practice Python(pandas  matplotlib  etc.) and SQL and have done a few small projects. I am constantly learning and working on projects given that I have the time.  Work experience wise I have only worked as a coding teacher at a learning center near my house.  What do you recommend I focus my energy towards the most? Is there anything I should do to increase my viability as a candidate in the internship hunt?
44,I heard all the bad takes on the Infinite footage  so I watched it expecting it to be atrocious. What am I missing? It looked fine.  Definitely just looked like more Halo  nothing amazing at all  but it certainly wasn’t terrible  was it? Or was it just that I didn’t watch it on a big screen in high enough resolution and missed something?  The impression I got was that it was much bigger environments and better frame rate with similar graphics.
45,I bought the GN34CB version on this monitor (this one is simply the same monitor with white instead of black) for $400 about a year ago and its been fantastic for me.

46,It's incorrect to assume non-tech companies don't do R&D in ML space. You just don't hear about it because  unlike FANG  they're not publishing.  Take consulting for example  nowadays AI is in a lot of solutions they sell. They just won't tell you what the model is because that's their secret sauce.  &#x200B   It's also incorrect to assume DS at tech are working on sexy bleeding edge problem btw. Quite possible they are just working on what everyone else is working on  it all depends on which team you're in.
47,It could be a mental health thing and not related to your work. If this is the case  u/themthatwas's response is good. It could be the result of burnout although I think that's less likely. It could be that you're spending all your time outside of work doing the same thing  and it's all getting too much. In this case I'd recommend  at least temporarily  just not spending loads of time doing things outside of work which are very similar or the same as what you do in your job. Maybe try and immerse yourself into something completely unrelated  like reading an unrelated book. Sometimes just mixing things up a bit helps.
48,"So many noisy Honda's.   So I live in the Vancouver BC area  there use to be a big Thursday night meet at Market Crossing  I would say about 350-600 cars. It was from ricers  muscles  classics  Donks  low riders  everything under the sun. Then It got shut down by the police  and now about 15-30 smaller car groups popped up. And they are all the same with different stupid names.   All Boss Cars  Low Class Royalty  One Crew Cruisin In Mind  Wide Open Throttle  Lower Mainland Car Club  Valley Car club.   It's the same group of 20-60 Honda bros that show up to smoke weed and vape and talk about their ""build"". You might see a few people at some meets but not others due to drama but it's still mostly the same group.   Ever since last year I stopped going to those meets and stick to the early morning ones with classic muscle cars. I'm losing a lot of enthusiasm I once had because if these garbage groups. The people my age join them. It's also ruined JDM cars for me because of these groups."
49,So before I say anything  here are my PC specs:      Ryzen 7 2700X 3.7GHz 4.1GHz Boost Clock     RX 5700XT ROG Strix OC 2.1GHz Core Clock 1750 Memory Clock     ROG Strix B450-f Gaming Motherboard     WD Blue 250GB M.2 NVME SSD     CORSAIR Vengeance PRO RGB 32GB 3200MHz     EVGA 650W Gold Power Supply     CORSAIR 220T Airflow Case     Samsung 1920x1080 60hz Monitor (OCed to 72hz)     My new monitor is the VIOTEK GN27DW 27-Inch Curved Gaming Monitor  First of all  I have to say  THE MONITOR IS SO GOOD.  But second of all  I am very confused about something.  So when I used my old 1080p monitor  I used to get a lot of lag in games that shouldn't lag for my system. (Roblox  Minecraft  Rocket League  TerraTech  pretty much any game.)  The framerate is really good but I got these random lag spikes  that were almost 0.5 to 1 second long. I was confused and I returned my graphics card. I pulled out the new one  didn't fix the issue.  But today I unboxed my new monitor  and suddenly  all these issues are gone. I ran all these games today  no lag spikes at all.  Now I'm very confused  because monitors can't affect performance  right? I think it was my old HDMI cable  because when I tried using it on my new monitor  it couldn't even render 144hz  only 75.  I tried the Display Cord.  No issues.  Now I don't know if HDMI cords can cause lag spikes/frame issues  but I'm wondering if this has ever happened to any of you guys. I would of never guessed it would be my cord. If you guys also think its something else  feedback would be well appreciated.  Thanks!

51,"The Earth's climate has been changing for 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for billions more. A data scientist should be able to come up with more tangible  realistic goals than to ""stop climate change"".  If you're interested in doing real work to further actual conservation of natural habitats and threatened/endangered species  almost every state in the US has an agency or organization dedicated to collecting data and doing modeling in support of ongoing conservation projects in partnership with local  state  and federal governments  military agencies  Indian tribes  university researchers  private companies  and various non-governmental organizations including The Nature Conservancy. For example: [Conservation Data Analysis](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Data/Analysis) in California or the [NatureServe](https://www.natureserve.org/) network of Natural Heritage programs.  My second job on the road to a career in data science was an undergraduate work-study for one of these Natural Heritage programs  collecting data from biologists' field reports  managing relational databases and combining the data the with satellite imagery in GIS to do spatial modeling on contracts for the US Forest Service and the US Army--all while learning from PhDs in ecology and geography. Even got to do field work to ground-proof my habitat model of a US military base and got a couple publications out of it as an undergraduate  though they were classified."

53,A data scientist can specialize in research and modeling  while a MLE often specializes in DNNs  reinforcement learning  GANs  and the like.  If it's work using Tensorflow or Pytorch it's usually MLE.  If it's R or Python it's usually DS.  MLEs tend to get paid more too.

55,Regarding proton in the UK  they got a really bad rep almost instantly for making crappy cars  and picked up a reputation for being old people cars.   However deserved it was for most of their products  they did make a couple of gems. Most people know the satria GTi was pretty good  and they made a huge deal of the lotus tuned suspension. Less well known was the proton coupe. This was a great handling little front drive coupe  and damn was it a neat little car. Sure it was awkward looking  and it wasn't exactly a rocket ship  but it drove great  and was far quicker point to point that it should of been. But  noone bought it  so  hardly anyone ever drove it either.
56,I have two degrees  but I’ve never actually enjoyed learning this much ha!   I really like being able to pause and walk away from things and come back when I’m feeling up to it.   I love being able to rewatch lectures if they are challenging and 2x speed over the boring stuff. It helps me not space out.  I love that the sections are short and I get those cute green check marks when I finish a video  quiz  or whatever.   The instructors are fantastic.  The price is right.   What are other platforms people use to learn?
57,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rU501xLtz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rU501xLtz8)  Hi!   I wanted to create a video series to provide better understanding and clarity to certain concepts commonly encountered in data science.  I would like to hear your constructive criticism on how I did  and any ideas for what I could improve  such as how I explained the topics  things I could incorporate into the video through editing  and such.   Thank you!
58,I can’t speak to how your code is specifically but your battles should be setup to have 2 “battlers” with one being on each side. By default it’ll load in as player vs AI but then if they choose to simulate it you just slot in the same AI logic to make it AI vs AI. The AI you built should be 90 % reusable in simulating what happens (only swapping out variable names and such). You don’t have to show anything too that can all run in the background and then just show the results screen at the end of processing (which should be very quick as AI is quick).
59,Really  Dungeon Fantasy RPG hits all your points. It uses the GURPS system  but is already distilled down to what you need for D&D-style fantasy.  Magic costs Fatigue instead of Vancian casting  and high skill levels reduce the fatigue cost. And of course you can learn new spells and increase your Fatigue pool.   There's also options for martial combat  such as targeting limbs or vitals. It also uses HP thresholds for reduced movement/dodging and unconsciousness/death checks.
60,Think twice about whether you want to leave behind a country with a health care system for one where people will be fighting each other with pool cues over cans of Chef Boy-Ar-Dee in a year if trends continue
61,Idk how popular of an opinion this is but I hope they just continue making Fighter Passes instead of new games.   Why rebuild the game every generation? The game's build is pretty solid. Plus  they may never be able to get all these character rights again for a new game. If I remember correctly  Snake was really difficult to secure again  and Square was stingy with Cloud's contents when it came to music.  Sakurai's workload could be drastically lighter if he just focuses on making 4-6 fighters a year instead of rebuilding a whole game with dozens of fighters every 8 years or so. Also  financially speaking  it's a much better labor - income model with wider profit margins. $25 every year or two  or $60 every 8-10 years?  My wish is that they would just port Super Smash Bros Ultimate to the next gen Nintendo consoles each cycle (with upscaled visuals and all previous DLC included)  and allow cross play with all versions of Ultimate and cross release future Fighter Passes across all the platforms.  I'd love to see this roster always expanding (instead of starting over) and the New Challenger hype train to chug along forever.

63,"What does ""Senior"" really mean?  For clarity  I would highly recommend use [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) and compare your position against the level system in big companies like Google or Facebook.  In small to median sized companies  they often give ""Senior"" titles to Ph.D. graduates. Those positions usually match with level 4 at big companies in terms of compensation and responsibility. However ""Senior"" in big companies refers to level 5 positions.  If you really want to understand the difference between ""Senior"" in small companies and ""Senior"" in big companies  by definition  the expectation for level 4 is you can complete things independently without much guidance and lead thing occasionally. For level 5  people are expected to lead and clarify big project  which may require couple years of experience for most people."

65,"I've read extensively about how how DS and MLE roles can differ  including talk about how variable it is between companies. However  I'm curious about how these job titles affect career growth if they have identical responsibilities.  I am currently in the final interview stages for two companies that are polar opposites:  **Company 1:** No MLEs but has a DS team. Data scientists do all of the engineering work typically associated with MLE.  **Company 2:** No DS but has a ML team. The MLEs do all of the model development work typically associated with DS.  For context  I'm a fresh PhD grad. All things being equal  do these job titles matter? Should I try to negotiate a ""scientist"" title for Company 1 because I do have a PhD? I realize I am in a very privileged position but would love to hear what /r/datascience thinks!"

67,Well I am from a statistics background too  however  I use python extensively at work. I agree with the other answers where they mention it's easier to integrate with other fields involving machine learning  data science. My advise would be to open to learn multiple language / skills. The industry is evolving and it's difficult for a specialist to grow ( in general). Being multi-facuted goes a long way here.

Don't presume you know your players' feelings better than they do: if they tell you they had fun at the session  trust them to know what they're talking about.  Maybe there's something you'd like to do differently / improve on / try out  and that's fine -- but do it for you  because you want to  not because you think your players are mistaken when they tell you they had a good time.  I've been working on this myself  in a professional capacity as well -- if someone in my field whom I respect tells me I did a cool thing  either I need to believe them  or else what good is respecting them doing either of us?"
71,You could see this as modding a game.  Obviously you shouldn't pretend that 100% of the code is your creation  still anything you add or modify is  even if code  game mechanics or features in general built on top of anything existing.  I can imagine that eventually your next or second next project can gradually step away from modding or copying an existing project to try creating a game from scratch  still using an existing engine for example.
72,In terms of practicing your skills  mobile games are fine. Unity will build to it pretty easily and all that.  In terms of making a commercial product: heck no. Mobile games have a ton of issues and requirements and are probably the most difficult market for actually making money. Mobile games are all about ad spend and user acquisition  and if you're a beginning without a budget  those things are not in your favor.   Keep working on your skills and you're ready  eventually  to try to earn a few bucks from game development  releasing a pay-what-you-want game on Itch is a much safer place to start.
73,"The only stats I routinely discount are anything to do with carrying capacity. While I certainly don't let players carry a million different things  I have never heard any player ever say  ""Wow  it sure is fun calculating weight!"" Instead  I keep it vague and spend my spoons on other stuff.   I don't let strong players get a bonus to Strength rolls by showing how much they can bench  so I don't let smart or charismatic players get a bonus to Intelligence or Charisma rolls. That said  I'll give a bonus to most any roll for creative or fun roleplaying if that's needed to help the group get into the game."
74,Given how successful COD and MW reboot is  it is a shame to see MoH franchise went downhill. In my eyes VR exclusive today is no different than launching candy crush version of the game.   Their 2010 game was epic  but had piss poor marketing and follow up didn't deliver.   Somewhere management fucked up big time and now some high up executive schmuk got a sign off on 'VR will be the turnaround for the franchise!'. It won't.
75,I had an idea for a swn/wwn campaign that looks something like star ocean/kingdom hearts/spelljammer. Big open reaches of space but all sorts of weird quirky worlds with different sci-fi  fantasy  whatever-punk skins and themes that can be traveled to and explored. I see it more as an extension of campaigns and settings previously run  run a variety of different campaigns over the years and then reveal that they're all part of a connected setting.
76,Well  there is this multiplayer game some people play with elaborately carved ivory pieces on top of a thick sheet of cardboard divided in squeares painted black and white.   I believe it's called Chess.  On a more serious note  I've been thinkering with electronics and microcontrollers of late and even tiny basic microcontrollers (the kind that costs less than a dollar) have enough processing power and memory space to implement some simple games like tic-tac-toe.
77,You know when you have a 'frog in your throat' and your voice is kinda bubbly if you talk before you cough.         That's what I thought his Unbreakable voice sounded like. Like even his throat was toughened so he spoke differently  with a touch of reverb too.
78,"First things first: diversity != ""not white"". Diversity  as I think any reasonable person would interpret it  is a distribution of talent that somewhat mirrors the distribution of demographics of the general population. So if you tell me ""oh  there are a lot of asian people in DS!""  that's great and all  but it doesn't offset the lack of black  hispanic  female  LGBTQ  etc. in the field.   Now  some people bring up the point that maybe people of different races/gender/sexual orientation just have a naturally different predisposition for DS. I'm not going to get into that argument  but I think it's fair to say that the more equality we see in society  the more these ""gaps"" have closed. So even if there is in the end some material gap between ethnicities  genders  etc.  we are really  really far from that true gap - we are still living in a time where the majority of that gap is due to nurture - or lack thereof.  Now  I don't see this as a problem just with DS - this is still a problem all across STEM. And the answer isn't as simple as saying ""we need to recruit more hispanic/black/women data scientists""  the answer starts all the way from parenting  through grade school  through college  through recruiting pipelines  through recruiting  through interviewing  through hiring.  To pick a spot  let's start with college. [Not only are hispanic/black students underrepresented in terms of getting a bachelor's degree](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_svc.pdf) but they are also [less likely to graduate from a STEM degree](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_reg.asp). And obviously those numbers get lower when you get to grad school - where grad degrees are becoming almost a de-facto requirement for data science roles.  So  right off the bat  by the time you hit the first milestone that is likely necessary for a career in data science  your talent pool in terms of ethnic diversity has already taken a hit.  Now we talk about pipelines. I can't find it right now  but I saw a video where someone broke down how companies that establish recruiting pipelines to specific colleges are fundamentally limiting their diversity. I don't remember the specific example by heart  but I believe the stat was about how Harvard had not one black graduate in one specific major one year. So if you  as a company  build pipelines to specific schools *and don't ensure those pipelines are diverse*  then here we are at a second step of the filtering process.  Then comes hiring. Hiring is not a bias-free exercise  and I think most of the time what you're going to find is that hiring managers are overwhelmingly likely to hire people that are ""like them"". And that can mean anything - similar educational background  similar origin  ethnicity  gender  political affiliation  communication style  technical competence  etc.   So  how do we address diversity? There is no one thing - you have to tackle it at every level.  It starts with children. It starts with raising"
79,1. Create a Discord Channel 2. Create a Facebook Page 3. Create Youtube Channel and create short gameplay videos 4. Facebook & Instagram sponsored ads drive many players in  depends what your marketing strategy is - spending few hundreds of dollars can start running things around  how ever you will have to stick to game metrics in order to see why people leave the game and so on so you can enhance those things.
80,[Classroom of the Elite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35507/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e_TV) is a good contender if you haven't seen that yet. I guess keep in mind that this anime was basically made just to sell more LNs  and is highly unlikely to get a second season  but it is exciting and well-paced (I was left satisfied.)   EDIT:  also  if you decide to watch Code Geass (I enjoyed it even if the writing was a little incoherent at times) and finish both seasons  try to watch [this OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34437/Code_Geass__Fukkatsu_no_Lelouch)/movie afterwords (don't look at that MAL page too closely or maybe at all yet because of potential spoilers.)
81,the download speed of a specific file it limited to the file location limitations. there is nothing you can do about it.  the speed test is your DL capability   so you can DL a file at that speed   but only if it has the upload bandwidth to support it.
82,I'd still go for at least Unity or Godot because they are easy to develop for  come with scene editing tools  have good documentation and community.  Alternatively  you can go for some niche engines like Coppercube (is that one still alive?)  Panda3D or Babylon.JS.
83,I feel like no one is willing to attempt a change because it risks incompatibility with existing parts  especially with cases which people hang on to for years. So then you get into multiple models with different designs etc which increases cost and confusion with consumers  Id love to see some changes but I dont think we'll see anything soon
84,  The current year 2020 can be called the desert year  unfortunately  because of the Corona pandemic that has temporarily paralyzed our entire planet from delays and cancellations that have led to the suspension of many businesses and industries  including the anime industry  for how many series  films and events have been postponed or canceled  so it was a sad year without He doubts at least in the first half  we do not know what is coming during the second half.But looking at the bright side  the coming year 2021 may be one of the strongest years because it will contain strong and awaited anime series and films  some of which have been waiting for their return for years and we will try to monitor the most important anime expected during the year 2021 and known to us so far.    Bleach:sennen kessen-hen  One of the anime that has been waiting for nearly eight years after the last episode of it was shown in 2012 without continuing the events with the last arc of the manga  the date of the show is 2021.    Gintama: Shinsaku   There aren't many details on the upcoming Gintama movie but who cares? Everyone who loves this great comic series is waiting for anything new about it  and for sure  a new Gintoki movie and his buddies will be reason enough to be on the waiting list.    Shaman King :  The return of the anime  the leader of the warriors  Shaman King  in a new anime series was a pleasant surprise without a doubt  especially with the popularity and success of the first season that was shown in 2002  but now the anime returns in a completely new way and will cover the events of the 35 volumes of the manga that ended on April 17th.    The Promised Neverland :  What a start to the year 2021 with one of the most successful anime last year  which presented a first episode that was a shock to everyone who did not read the manga or was not aware of the essence of the story  and The Promised Neverland succeeded in attracting the attention of many people over the course of 12 episodes to leave us longing and waiting To know the fate of the children  but next January we will continue this terrifying and exciting journey with the events of the second season.  to know more: https://cartooncn2020.blogspot.com/2020/10/most-awaited-anime-of-2021.html
85,"Just drag and drop the resources into your project folder  either via the bottom left panel in the editor marked ""Filesystem"" or in your operating system's file manager. There's also an [import tab](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/assets/import_process.html) for handling settings of how you import things."
86,I work for a large multinational institution and I was hired out of >300-large applicant pool. Multiple programming languages and Master's level statistical knowledge were explicitly required in the job description. In the end  90% of my job turned out to be creating charts in Excel.  Not every company works like that  but this is unfortunately very common in entry level positions.
87,"Yeah. Its pretty easy to see who didn't study CS when looking at peoples work.  You can get by if the data scale is small enough.  I think scale is the potential issue. I believe people who learn strictly from the ""data science"" side of things will tend to be ill-equipped to deal with real life when it comes to dealing with hundreds of terabytes of data that you cant just load into a pandas dataframe and manipulate easily.  Often these databases are not designed with analysis in mind and they are traditional relational data stores  frequently transactional  and creating a window function in SQL to segment fucktons of data or using pandas try to df.iterrows() just connecting directly to it is a pain."
88,I'll be honest  I'm not sure. Never seen anything like that before. Does it look like something is clogging one of the pin holes? It's a little hard to tell.   You can try placing the cpu into the socket like normal and see if it seats completely. Remember  zero insertion force.
89,When I last looked at Dataquest they they were heavily focused on the practical side of things i.e how to code. I'd guess that if they've added more theoretical stuff then it's probably not super in-depth (which is what DataCamp did when they added theory based courses)  but I could be wrong.   You can audit Coursera courses for free - basically you get access to most of the lectures and material but you can't submit the assignments. I'd strongly suggest trying out any Coursera course you're thinking of taking before committing to paying for it.
90,Ideas can not be protected.   Only ways to execute them.  This idea is a bit weird to grasp and has a lot of real world weirdness around it.   But the key takeaway is that game mechanics can not be protected because a mechanic is an idea  a form of interaction between rules. It's abstract and frankly impossible to define in a specific narrow way that copyrights or trademarks require.  BUT the exact implementation of the mechanic is protected.   So if you make the exact same game with the same numbers and the same everything then you're infringing their rights. But if you make a substantially similar game yourself you are legally in the clear.   ...that said since this is a legal topic there's two huge asterisks attached to this statement.   1. If the rights holder doesn't sue no one cares. So if the company went bankrupt its quite likely the current owners don't even know they have the right to it let alone knowing of the existence of the game. Do your research here to be safe.   2. You don't need to be wrong to be sued and destroyed financially. The legal system around copyright is in most aspects designed around two parties with permanent lawyers on staff settling a disagreement. If you do not have the means to defend yourself legally it unfortunately doesn't really matter whether you are right or wrong. You will come out worse off.      So if the rights are at a company that does enforce the rights its generally a good idea to stay overly clear of whatever they are doing or at least be prepared to immediately pull and change your game should you receive a cease and desist letter. As usually you won't be sued immediately but instead are told to back off.       It is a really good idea to be prepared for that and adhere to that immediately as a small  independent developer.
91,I like this show i do but please oh god please let the amnesia thing be over by the end of the next episode or so  just let the bad ass half demon sisters be happy and together again without dragging out a boring amnesia plot for god knows how long.   I get it's an easy way to generate drama between characters but man do i hate it.
92,I'm in a great position where I'm the Data Analytics department so everything kind of falls on my plate. I'm a Data Analyst/BI Developer and now am starting to dabble in internal Web Development so I do a lot of report writing  but also get to work on building visualizations in Python for ad-hoc requests. I'm encouraged to be curious about the data in the company and given a lot of leeway to kind of make my own path. I'm kind of between Finance and IT since I used to be an Accountant  but have been given the go ahead recently to develop an enterprise wide BI solution and start to get rid of some costly 3rd party BI tools that have kind of been cobbled together. On top of some database development  getting to work with the C-Suite on a regular basis in finding new projects and now being able to work on learning some web development for internal admin dashboards  I'm pretty happy. One thing I hated about my past job was never being able to code at work and so far at this job I've gone from SQL to Python to DAX and now to HTML/CSS/JS so I'm pretty happy.
93,Endurance. I get super tired about two and half hours in  and I start looking for a stopping point.   Also  I grew up in a time where DMs believed in being stingy with magic items  so I’m way too generous with them. But I’ve always been more into He-Man and Thundercats than I was into Tolkien  so everybody having a magic sword or shield just feels right to me.   I also do everything in my power not to kill a PC. There are other more interesting ways to fail than to die. I don’t care if other DMs think I’m a wuss. Imagine if Batman or Captain America died every time they failed or lost a fight instead of rallying and mounting a comeback later in the movie.   I think I’m also not great at running monsters. I’ve pitted some high CR beasts at my group  and they wreck them. I’ve even tried going a few CRs higher than their levels because of all the magic gear I heap upon them  but I’m just really bad at multitasking several monsters with whacky powers all at the same time.
94,"Linus Tech tips also posted a video on an 88"" $30k monitor:   https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/iy3wzs/linus_tech_tips_rtx_3090_first_in_the_world/  Nvidia also shipped him the monitor  probably the HDMI cable  and a guide of which settings to use on which games.   This is pretty bleeding edge stuff still for a while. We are talking almost $35 000 in hardware for an 8k gaming experience that's noticeably different than 4k."
95,Acchi kocchi  as far i know its not exactly a hidden gem but seems like not many people know about it.  Its basically a slice of life anime with your typical high-school and it's just cute. Nothing special about it but I love it.
96,I refused to believe I was a good DM until I realized that voices don't matter. It's just not the kind of person I am. I try to create an atmosphere with words and describe things to my players in detail and make characters that they want to interact with.
97,this capacitor issue isnt reddits doing  its the speculation of igorslab who has been working in the chip design industry for decades  so he may know a thing or two about this topic.  its also rather easy to find out of his theory is right or wrong once availability improves. just get a zotac card and find it out yourself. then get an asus/msi card and find out they dont crash at 2ghz+  most aib 3080 cards were asus tuf and msi trio who do not suffer from this issue and therefore never crashed beyond 2ghz in the tech press reviews
98,"They really should just delay this for the health / safety of workers across the board from development to manufacturing to shipping to retail to promotional tour workers.   Many of the most major launch titles are already being delayed. You might as well just delay the console too. A large chunk of day-one buyers are out of work anyway so that crucial initial install base is gonna take a hit. It's not unreasonable to believe that a lackluster launch by one console would absolutely give an edge to the competitor product who may have ""the brand new thing"" releasing to more hype when consumers are actually able to afford it and willing to splurge after basically an entire year in quarantine.  It is absolutely a stubborn idea to launch either console by Holiday 2020."
99,I mean  the entire point of developing anime artstyles is to reduce complex shapes into simpler ones  so I'd argue it's kinda counterproductive to seek realism within the medium. Noses are particularly difficult to render since they lack a color or texture which may distinguish them from the rest of the face  which is why they're always the first ones to go.
100,FWIW  I’m on Unity 2019 LTS and use the built in smooth time:  https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-smoothDeltaTime.html  ... and it basically fixed things. 🤷‍♂️  Here’s the game: https://doublerobot.com/blazesky   I was getting ship and bullet stutter before. Also had to turn on prediction for the player physics.
101,Idk. As much as I want to be hyped for this  the quality of SE games have been lackluster lately. Seems the KH series goal was to make each game shorter and with less content than the previous title. XV was awesome to look at  but really has no replay value. I mean  hard mode in 7R is the same game just no items  and like 2 extra side missions.. How lazy is that? The last final fantasy that I played and thoroughly enjoyed was 12. Open-ish world with a really cool and in depth battle system with TONS of side content and challenging bosses. Make something of a mix of 12 and 15 and I’m down. Otherwise  I’ll keep my money and watch the reviews bomb... again.
102,"Threaten something that you're actually willing to follow through on? For example say you'll kill a beloved NPC  and then when they refuse to cooperate  actually do it. Or maybe you could threaten to make them pariahs  and then brand each of them with a criminal's brand. Etc  Ect  Blah.  Otherwise  maybe you could make the options less black-and-white? Instead of ""help me or I'll hurt you"" it could be ""choose a cool magic item"" or ""choose a character to rescue"".  So both options are along a similar vein to one another..."
103,Data analyst - SQL  Python  Advanced analysis  mostly interested in presenting facts  asking questions  running queries — supports business use cases but aren’t accountable  Data engineering - builds pipelines  cloud skills  foundational engineering  sql  Python/Java/scala  streaming — makes data available to data scientists and data analysts when they need it — focused on technical use cases  Data scientists - builds models that support business use cases. notebooks  sql  Python  R  Machine learning engineer - supports the data scientist for complex production grade ML systems. A combo of DS and DE with focus on technical use cases.  Then you get into sales which most people seem to leave out. There are data scientists who mediate between technical users and business users to align projects to strategic initiatives. They help secure funds for everyone.
104,You can do the breaks yourself for cheap as hell  if you don't know how just watch a Chris fix video.   Not turbo Subaru's are pretty reliable outside of the head gaskets as long as you keep them topped up with oil.   A car at that mileage will need maintenance items like breaks  timing components and other wear items no matter what brand.
105,Wow a game with a digital release sells faster than the games released 15+ years ago that you could only buy on CD.  Crazy shit.  Thankfully the series has remained dormant for so long everyone forgot how to play the game so they're not mad about paying $40 for something that can be beat in under half an hour.
106,That's not the most unreasonable CL ad I've seen. No doubt the guy is asking less than what he paid brand new. But by what's available today it is still overpriced. I would pay $550 for that...$650 absolute maximum.
107,Something like ISL/ESL text would give you the statistics you need. There are many courses based on them but you can literally just read them.  For calculus any 1st year undergraduate multivariate calculus course is probably OK. Just need to understand the derivative and Taylor's expansions. Use the matrix cookbook to figure out how to take matrix/vector derivatives. It will be quite simple if you stick to the standard ML stuff.   If you do more hardcore theory stuff then you might need more math. Like for geometric/topological ML  riemannian and non Euclidean geometry  Hilbert spaces for kernels etc.   Convex optimization (eg Stanford Boyd) will also help somewhat.
108,I am using the initiative system from an old Swedish game called Western. I don't know if there is some English-language game that uses the same system  but I'm assuming there is. I wanted to see if anyone knew if there was an app or similar that would automatically sort/track the initiative for this system? In essence  a combatant gets one turn for every 10 they get in Initiative. E.g. creature A gets initiative 12 and creature B gets initiative 25. The turn order would look like this:  B - 25 B - 15 A - 12 B - 5 A - 2 End round.  Does it make sense? Anyone know of an app or such that could track such a system?
109,I wonder what's up with random reads being slower than random writes. The sequential performance is blazing but unless they can get it to put up good random performance it won't be particularly helpful to most people over one of the faster PCIe3 ssds.
110,I've agreed with the Apple and Google Play suit  Fortnite flat out broke their Terms of Service there.  But this is just a petty company trying to get easy money. Coral Castle isn't winning this suit. Save for the name  there's barely even a resemblance.
111,Firstly  Stars Without Number Revised does include Space Opera rules that help to reduce the lethality and make your heroes more capable at early levels. I recommend checking those out if you're still willing to give SWN a look.  Nothing has tools for creating a sci-fi setting like SWN does. It's the Gold standard for a reason. That said  those tools are designed to be separable from the core mechanics  so if that's something you like I'd recommend using them no matter what system you use for the actual gameplay.  Then I recommend Star Wars FFG (specifically Edge of the Empire or Age of Rebellion if you want more military edge). It's dead-simple to house-rule it to be human-centric and to disallow Force use in both games.   * I recommend using the Genesys Archetypes in place of the Star Wars human species if you have access to it to give your characters a bit more variation. * You'd want to file the serial numbers off of the vehicles  but in a lot of cases that's as simple as renaming them. * The game is medium crunch  maybe slightly crunchier than SWN  but not approaching Traveller. The Dice Pool system does take some learning  but is more intimidating than it is complicated.  If that's a no-go  I'd recommend Scum and Villainy. Full-disclosure  I haven't read it  but its a narrative system in the vein of Blades in the Dark designed around a team of spacefarers in their own ship. It has a completely different set of base assumptions than the more traditional games  but I would call it more 'modern' in that way. (I think Aliens and Space Magic are more intrinsically baked in in that game than in Star Wars  but again... I haven't read it so I'm unsure on that point).
112,How rural in Maine? I live in Maine too and there are often car shows (they call them cars and coffee) on Sundays when it’s not winter. There’s a big one once a month in NH called Seacoast Cars and Coffee.
113,I suspect they are size constrained on the epyc package. The dies there are packed much closer together.   If they want to fit the same eight dies along with the exact same IO die onto the same socket  there isn't much room to make the Zen 3 die bigger.
114,I've had the AX200 for at least a year now and it's been great. Probably not worth upgrading? But a minor upgrade might still be worth it because I paid about $20 and can def get $15 by selling locally.
115,"As a Genesis owner\*  the ""fanbase"" is interesting.  The brand has no prestige so some owners compensate with attitude/ego or cosmetic mods  while others just enjoy having a luxury bargain.  There's also a big difference between the coupe owners and the sedan owners  since the coupe owners are hardcore enthusiasts and the sedan owners just wanted a bargain Mercedes (although some G70 owners blur the line).  \*Yes  the manufacturer wasn't actually Genesis until 2017.  I'm just using it for simplicity.  Some ""Genesis"" owners really don't like uttering the name ""Hyundai"" and will rebadge their pre-2017 cars Genesis because of it."
116,While I would love to see competition grow  how about we see applications that can effectively use more than 3 or 4 cores  before we push CPUs that have 50X that number of cores?  The software is greatly lagging the hardware and it has been like this for ages now.
117,That reminds me of the fuel coupon at Fleet Farm.  If you make a purchase in the store  they push a 4 cent per gallon coupon on you for the gas station  limit 100 gallons.  So  if you manage to use it to its full potential and somehow purchase 100gal  (in case you werent aware  thats roughly 400 litres) you save a whopping $4.00 on your roughly $200+ purchase.  But wait theres more!  Every fuel purchase also gets a free bag of terrible popcorn!
118,I built a simple model using voice-to-text to differentiate between normal rap and mumble rap. Using NLP I compared the actual lyrics with computer generated lyrics transcribed using a Google voice-to-text API. This made it possible to objectively label rappers as “mumblers”.  Feel free to leave your comments or ideas for improvement.   [https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-mumble-rap-using-data-science-fd630c6f64a9](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-mumble-rap-using-data-science-fd630c6f64a9)
119,That doesn't seem like a lot for a new connector  like if connector is rated for 10amps  its gotta do 10amps after few hundred inserts..  and you want huge safety margin so connector better be able to actually do like 20amps after few hundred inserts for you to rate it to do 10  and if it can do 20 amps after few hundred inserts it can probalby do 40 amps when brand new.  Numbers obviously made up but you get idea.
120,I'm a young driver in my teens  and personally I love Japanese cars. My attainable dream car is a R33 GT-R. It might be because I grew up playing older racing games and I always picked Japanese cars to differentiate myself from the AI  not really sure. I live in a very affluent area and most kids my age are getting the German cars as a flex or bigger American cars while I'm here looking at 350Zs  WRXs  IS350s  etc. In my school parking lot there *might* 2 or 3 Japanese enthusiast cars or the standard Civic/Corolla/Camry  otherwise it's usually BMWs  Golfs  Mercedes  Jeeps  or the odd Tesla.  Still trying to figure out who owns the S2K and RX-8 in the school parking lot  they're clean.
121,Weapon systems.  Yeah... those autocannons have fully automatic aimbot now and can find a squirrel using thermal cameras and fire a shot (that will accurately hit it 2km away) faster than you can blink.  Similarly intelligence gathering  profiling people etc. It's extremely easy for a state to identify and locate wrong thinkers nowadays.

123,This looks like the Big Navi if it's heavily bottlenecked at the 'heavy batches' setting and does really badly at it.    Note that it's a DX11 result while the rumored 3080 benchmark is with DX12   Normal - 96.1     Medium - 75.5   Heavy - 42.9            2080Ti numbers(DX11) :    Normal - 86.9    Medium - 64.6       Heavy - 51.9              Rumored 3080 numbers:    Normal - 102.5   Medium - 88.6    Heavy - 77.4   edit: On AMD sub  somebody posted the link of the user from where this was taken. The user has 5700XT results as well   Normal - 75.2   Medium - 53.3   Heavy - 41.6    So heavy batches is barely better than 5700XT while medium batches show the best gains at 41.7%
124,Writing up a summary of the project geared towards a potential stakeholder would be a great next step.  Either a simple markdown readme file or even a PowerPoint deck.  When I look at a github project of a potential candidate I want a quick 1-page summary of what the project is  what it does  and what could be done with it.    Demonstrating that you can explain the project clearly is a very important skill and one that is often missing.
125,"I am building a Recommendation System that recommends relevant Articles to the User. I am doing this using simple Similarity-based techniques(Jaccard) using the features "" Page Title  Tags and Article content"". Now my problem is I have different Adult Articles and some are articles that expire(Eg. An Article about a movie in Jan 2019 would not be relevant in Dec 2019).  I want to keep these Adult articles separate as a person who is reading about history does not want to be led to an Adult Article and not recommend articles that have expired or would not be relevant in the present moment.  Should I just improve the quality of my Features or tags? Or is there any other way to achieve this?"
126,Are any of them interested in hiring some interns? I'm a Mechatronics Engineer student  I'll graduate soon  but I  really like data science and it would be awesome to have the opportunity to work in the field
127,>the Nano 2GB uses a 64-bit quad-core ARM A57 processor running at 1.43GHz and is complimented by a 128-core Nvidia Maxwell GPU  Maxwell? Really? Why not at least pascal? Is the jetson also on 28nm or did nvidia really port maxwell to a new node for some reason?
128,My engine oil dip stick broke  so I've been driving without it for a month.    I started hearing loud noise when driving at 50+ MPH for 10+minutes.     The noise stops when i apply brakes or when driving below 50mph.   What could it be? Does the oil dip stick have anything to do with it?      This is what it sounds like    https://v.redd.it/jhz6aivzkzr51
129,"Two things here:  It is possible that your players enjoy a different style of game. A lot of people aren't really into the whole ""hard  challenging  low power"" thing.   And secondly  if your have problems with player progression  your players want real progression  but you want to run low-powered games (and have players who also like that)  simply play shorter campaigns. Start low-powered  don't limit progression to hard  progress to mid-powered  have a nice ending of the campaign  and start a different game in a different system.  Also  as additional advice  i have noticed that a lot of GMs feel as if they need to challenge the players  and feel like they are losing control if players become powerful. I felt the same. Then I just stopped worrying  and it turned out that the problem really didn't actually exist. Let the players get powerful. Let them stomp stuff a bit  or try to throw harder stuff at them. If they stomp it  that is fine. If the game starts getting boring  play a new campaign.  Also  the more narrative your game system  the less these problems apply. If you have a tight  tactical combat system with a focus on fair  balanced fights  stuff is hard. If you have a more narrative system which might handle a combat or a situation in 1-2 rolls  it doesn't really matter. I can highly recommend Blades in the Dark style systems for this."
130,**Princess Mononoke** (Sub) – Found this to be very similar to Nausicaa. It was still great but I didn’t enjoy it quite as much as I don’t think the characters were as likable. It did remind me of Okami though which was a nice throw-back to one of my favourite games.  Also revisited an old favourite: **Patlabor: The Movie** but watched the Bandai dub this time just to change things up a bit. It’s actually a *very* good dub which is a lot coming from me seeing as I rarely enjoy them. A few of the casting choices were a bit weird imo but everyone put in a good performance so it didn’t matter too much in the end.
131,That’s what they get for using digital river as their store front. Digital river has done literally fuck all to improve the digital store front formula.  EDIT: For anyone working for digital river. hey  look  I know that you’re probably doing a great job  but over all  the company overall has dropped the ball way too many times. We’re not looking for any magic here  just transparency about how everything is going to go down. You have 50 units to distribute? Let all of us know. It’ll still suck  but I’m entirely positive that the community will appreciate it!  EDIT2: That goes for any manufacturer or distributor by the way  if you let your customers know in advance that shit is fucked. You’ll very likely get way more respect then letting it go down the way it has been for the last couple of years.
132,I really liked 2016’s multiplayer. Shame it didn’t get improved and expanded upon. I liked the customization and unlock system. The character movement and animations just needed work and some balancing of weapons and demons. Also modes with no demons and just slayers. I liked the fast-paced doom/halo mix. I’m probably a minority. What are y’alls thoughts on 2016’s and Eternals multiplayer?
133,That's truly double 2080 Super performance in a DX12 benchmark according to the best scores on [HWBOT.org](https://HWBOT.org).  The highest scores for 2080 Supers using SLI/NVLink and without sub ambient cooling are:  Time Spy score: 21137  Time Spy Extreme score: 10964.
134,If a sci-fi setting sounds good  Mothership is a great adaptation of Alien-esque horror that gets into action quickly. Their Dead Planet module might be more than one or two sessions but is really well fleshed out https://www.mothershiprpg.com/dead-planet#buy
135,In my personal experience.  Places where R excels:  1. Data Visualization (ggplot2  although Python is catching up slowly) 2. Tabular Data Manipulation (data.table >>> pandas) 3. Statistical Analysis 4. Ad-hoc Analysis  which is really just a combination of the top 2  Places where Python excels:  1. Deep learning 2. Production pipelines 3. Going 'outside' (web scraping  json/xml work  interacting with things that aren't native Python)  Point 1 and 2 for Python tend to be deal breakers for a lot of positions - want to do deep learning? You'll need Python. Want to put something in production? It's possible in R  but TBH not worth it since the documentation is usually terrible.
136,Dash or windshield mount puts the phone right in your field of view depending how you adjust it. It's great for not taking your eyes down and off the road  visibility could be an issue but it's easy to position it correctly or just see around it. Unless you have an enormous phone or a tablet  obviously.
137,There have been some significant advances with carbon nanotube based logic lately. In fact  first 90nm CN CMOS + RRAM wafers have been taped out at this point (3DSoC). I have no idea how far away their goal of a proper process still is (yield  performance  logic&memory density  power  design libraries  foundry equipment  ...) but it looks quite promising. Since it's rather hard to find  I'll leave those links here :  [DARPA ERI 2020 talk on 3DSoC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJh7EMWa6J0&t=3364)  an article from last year: [First 3D Nanotube and RRAM ICs Come Out of Foundry](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/devices/first-3d-nanotube-and-rram-ics-come-out-of-foundry) and the foundry's [Early Access program](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/3dsoc-eap/).
138,For a different take on this idea  maybe look to Ryuutama  which has an emphasis on travel rather than fighting  and on 'ordinary folks' rather than 'lunatic adventurers'.  It certainly meets all of your bullet points.

140,"I am a hiring manager for DS  I'll let you know right now that most DS jobs require a masters or PhD. The main reason being most bachelors programs are insufficient for teaching the required skills.  The problem for you saying ""why does it matter if I have the skills"" is that you are asking people like us to go through potentially 1000s more resumes to find the one diamond in the rough if we allow people with non advanced degrees to apply.  Now in reality  we don't go through the resumes  recruiters do. They are looking for specific things in a resume that make it worth passing those resumes onto hiring managers. If you apply without an advanced degree  that is an easy filter for recruiters to remove your resume from the stack. The goal of the recruiters is to reduce the 100s of applications down to the best candidates (and that includes removing overqualified candidates  since we probably won't reach their salary demands).  If you are serious about breaking into the DS market in the US  so yourself a favor and get an advanced degree. With experience plus the degree you are more likely to get your resumes passed onto hiring managers by recruiters.  Just me 2 cents"
141,Hi  I just finished my Bachelor's in Technology in Electrical  and Electronics Engineering and I'm looking to take my career into data science. I have done some certification courses  can I sign up for this?
142,This also comes with an with extra details on [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/atomic-heart-new-story-and-next-gen-console-details-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x) about the game  as well as next gen releases.     \-[News credit](https://stitch.games/news/atomic-heart-new-gameplay-of-mini-boss-fight-released/).
143,Yeah the redneck and biker community has fully embraced rice  which is fucking hilarious. Shit like that would get you laughed off of forums a few years ago  now it's cool all of a sudden cause the domestics are doing it. Several lifted trucks  mustangs  and harleys driving around my town with em.
144,I am a newbie. I am in the process of becoming a data scientist.  I do not have work experience in this field. I have to take some computer science courses.  Can I work as a data scientist online while traveling abroad? Basically can I work as a digital nomad + data scientist?  Can I work part time in this role or do I have to work full time?  Thanks!
145,Thanks to everyone who took a shot at this.  I did some more digging  and it looks like the only ways to do this are:  1. count resource usage programatically yourself (or  in my case  tinker with Allegro's innards to make it count for me when in debug mode and recompile (which actually sounds like a useful patch to submit for the community at large...)) 2. use the vendor-specific extensions 3. write a wrapper-script/func around [glxinfo](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-find-linux-vga-video-card-ram/) (horribly inelegant and not cross-platform  but this isn't supposed to be a public-facing feature anyway and I plan to remove it before release)  I'm basically trying to make sure older laptops blessed/afflicted with Intel HD 2500 graphics don't cough up a lung and die  but it sounds like having 4 1024×512 textures stay resident (non-tileable hand-drawn sky) with no mipmap is only going to cost me 8mb  so maybe I can worry about this a little less.
146,"I'm surprised Leo had enough energy to punch his attacker in the torso. I'm loving this Erika x Leo moment  I ship them more than Tatsuya and Miyuki. Erika's out for some blood because no one messes with her ~~boyfriend/man~~ classmate/dojo student.  Lina giving us some fanservice as she's changing her clothes. If only  First High allows Lina to walk around the school without her necktie and her dress unbuttoned. I love how Lina took her time to change by posing in the mirror  she's got a great rack & cleavage even though I'm  an ass man. Lina's attire during her meeting without her Parade spell makes her look like Hayasaka from Kaguya-sama: Love is War.  P.S. I'm still mad that the subs refer to Tatsuya as ""brother"" instead of ""onii-sama""."
147,Hello!  This is just a friendly remind that the [public comment period](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/hys66k/were_updating_the_rules/) is over and the [new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/wiki/rules) are in effect.
148,"Anyone complaining about power usage?  People who had Vega were grilled so hard because of power usage... And this thing is a hog.   People were saying  ""Regardless of performance  if it uses over 250W  it's not worth it.""  Now I'm seeing people praise Nvidia for cranking out huge TDP  suddenly shrugging off the power requirements.  If you have to upgrade your PSU  keep that cost in mind. Around $130 for a solid 850W. In addition to the $700 or $800 with AIB."
149,"My fundamental issue with the series is how it does not take itself seriously  as a work of art.  I cannot speak for everyone  but I am sure many people felt rather disappointed that the whole premise of Satoru traveling to the past was... never elaborated upon. There is no third party  no universal power that wanted to right the wrongs  no philosophy - just a man jumping back into his past to change the present. No high stakes  no dangers  just supernatural for the sake of supernatural.  The series itself was nothing special. Just a little children adventure with a serial killer subplot. It had created a powerful atmosphere  but there was nothing else to it. And the ending abruptly ""serving justice"" without any ""BUT"" or ""HOWEVER"" and ""ACTUALLY"" is simply a lack of dedication to author's own creation."
150,You see them around all the time. I was wondering what it was like to drive one of them  compared to say  an F-250? Every so often I see the really short wheelbase version with a stakebed body  and it doesn't look that unmanageable.
151,Quick Q: I’ve been out of the loop for a bit but when Mark Cerny did that presentation where he showed the internals of a PS5 architecture  he showed a card that had PS1  PS2  and I think PS4 games as well... what happened to that?
152,Yea  Wizards is amazing with this stuff.  They actually provided a whole set of books for a game club that I was running at a school in Baltimore City.    I'm no longer running that club(most of the kids graduated or joined a sports team)  so if anyone is running a DND club in the Baltimore City area  I have tons of books  minis  MTG cards  board games and other tabletop gaming resources to assist with! (Post-covid  of course).
153,Yes  lack of experience.  Take some real project.  Or you can try to compete in numer.ai competition. I found it very engaging. They have very hard dataset and very nice community. You can learn a lot there.
154,My traps are puzzles. I don't mean that they're literal puzzles  but that my traps mean something. There's always a reason that a particular trap is set in a particular way. Once players realize they can learn things from traps and the reasons they are the way they are  they start having fun talking and thinking and trying to decode them.
155,The character I am creating for an upcoming campaign is a wizard who follows the art of astrology in his practice of magic. Im planning on having him consult the stars pretty much every time there is a big decision/action to make. Can anyone think of some dnd constellations and corresponding myths and actions to take from these constellations?
156,This may sound kind of odd  but I've seen some absolutely crazy stuff from BMW forums. Stuff that no other luxury brand group replicates (closest maybe Porsche people)  Sure  there are definitely some of the annoying owners (looking at you N54 guys)  but then you have guys who have money and skill to go completely off their rocker. I've seen people doing stress and dynamics analysis on suspension components  obsessive weight reduction efforts  even someone that swapped their S65 out for a P65 engine from an actual racing car (that was a guy local to me). Some cool stuff if you can get away from the upper layer of super obnoxious owners
157,"I am the curator (not the author) of this dataset. I also work in a hospital as an AI researcher.  I can see your point  and I do agree with you in regards to how much of kaggle's content is often based on popularity and not on substance.  &#x200B   In this dataset however  you *can* use time as a feature  depending on what practical application you are going for.  From the [original paper](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5) available in the dataset description:  >""In the previous part of the analysis  we excluded follow-up time from the dataset because we preferred to focus on the clinical features and to try to discover something meaningful about them. Follow-up time  however  can be an important factor in the survival of patients  and should not be eliminated completely from this study.""  Essentially  a timeless model would represent what a hospital/clinic would have at the appointment time for on-the-spot decision making  but once the patient left the hospital grounds his care must still be monitored and while he may be ok at the time that condition can quickly deteriorate.  For such case  discarding time would hinder the chances of helping that person after the appointment  and heart failure is very unforgiving.  &#x200B   I would add that the submissions mostly leave correct validation to be desired   It is a small  mildly unbalanced dataset and creating small testing sets without stratification will surely sway the results  especially if only executed once.  &#x200B   Despite this technicality  I don't think your point about popularity vs actual substance is any less valid.  Kernels  discussion and datasets seem to be too influenced by the amount of followers rather than on the quality of the content itself.  &#x200B   I believe this is caused by the lack of a content review/sorting/recommendation system  that could distinguish between the two and properly give relevance to them.  In an ideal case scenario there would be a clear distinction between attempts to learn and attempts to generate scientific content.  In one  its upvotes for effort  in another its for results.  Its ok to be wrong  everybody has to start somewhere - but it becomes a problem when those 99% claims start to rise or even worse  be published.  &#x200B   I would say that competitions remain strong in the sense of quality. The solution write-ups and some great competitors often overshadow what we have published in scientific literature.  People like Chris Deote  Heng Cheng  Owl taught me so many great things that I have yet to find somewhere else.  In my experience it is not just the kaggle or the AI fever that causes this  many PhD's and MSc's that I've worked with did not properly knew how to tune a random forest.  At the end of the day these are all static titles in a dynamic reality. And no title fully captures a data scientist's capacity  some doesn't seem to capture anything at all.  &#x200B   For what it is worth it "
158,As a 3700x + vega64 owner I'm going to grab a new gpu first in the 3080/big navi category and see how cpu bottlenecked I am  by the time I actually manage to get my hands on a gpu in stock the cpu price will probably be a but cheaper  hopefully...
159,In other words  which is the most fascinating topic in machine learning? It may be survival analysis  sparse learning  neural networks or anything else.   In my opinion  Bayesian statistical modeling is the most interesting. You can do so many things with so little data if you have minimal prior knowledge about your data.  If I had more time  I would have studied very deeply this topic.
160,The other users on this thread are seriously underestimating the popularity of BL and the size of the fujoshi community (Comiket is close to 50-50 in terms of gender split for participants--there's just as many yaoi doujins getting sold as male-targeted doujins.)  But to your question: this gets asked every so often  and there's no way of knowing for sure  but there's likely a couple of factors.   One  maybe despite the popularity of BL  anime producers have gotten it in their heads that it won't sell. I don't think this is true at all  but there may be some kind of bias on the part of the (male) anime producers that it won't be as profitable to target their works at female audiences.  Two  this notion  while potentially a bit sexist  might also be a bit true  because female audiences will often support male-targeted anime  while male audiences might not support BL.  And in fact  three  fujoshi fanbases generally tend to form around male-targeted (often shonen) works. Since really the beginning of the genre  yaoi was often taking characters from shonen series and pairing them together. One of the first examples of this was Captain Tsubasa. I don't know if it was the actual origin of yaoi or not  but I do know that it was one of the first series to have a lot of yaoi doujinshi made of it  and it helped popularize the BL/yaoi genres. So since a good part of BL & yaoi culture is already centered around shonen and seinen content  fujoshi support those series like crazy. (If you wanted to put a different spin on it  you could say that empowered fujoshi have appropriated or re-incorporated shonen works for themselves.)
161,In order to manage and share them properly  you kind of need to have a support system that is outside of the notebooks themselves. Seems like that is what many of the suggestions are saying here.   The issue of course is all the manual labor involved and the repeated opportunities for mistakes  etc. This is compounded by the fact that data scientists aren't developers  as mentioned quite a bit below  and aren't schooled in the tools and processes that decrease errors  etc.  Best thing to do is provide some automation for versioning and organization  but it requires hooks  etc.
162,Can a novice mechanic like me change the timing belt and water pump and accessory belts easily? Or is it a hard or complicated job?  I have looked up how to do it and it seems like it could be difficult to accomplish
163,What is your routine (if any) or go to technique for Feature Reduction/Selection?  For example  If my data has several thousand features  I typically try {2 3 4} things right away depending on circumstances.  Zero variance/Near zero variance  * Using [R package caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/pre-processing.html#zero--and-near-zero-variance-predictors)  * Remove zero variance and near-zero variances  * Then by using [nzv$PercentUnique](https://youtu.be/qhvkVxuwvLk?t=385) I may remove the bottom quartile of features depending on the range of PercentUnique's.  Correlation to find multicollinearity  * I find the correlation matrix and [remove values > 0.75](https://topepo.github.io/caret/pre-processing.html#identifying-correlated-predictors) and remove  * I have seen others use correlations > 0.5 or 0.6  but don't have any references for it.  Boruta / Random Forest  * Love [Boruta package](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v036i11) but it takes a while  * Then use Forward Feature Selection.  PCA  * Depending on the nature of the data I will try PCA last  * If the model must be explainable then I skip this  * I may use several criteria: 80  90  95% error explained  * Forward Feature selection  look for first \~3:10 orthogonal features
164,Are you really asking if churn prediction is a waste of time because we can't forsee that a seagull shits on someone's head in their convertible  they have an accident and run into HR from a competitive company who offers them a better job on the spot...therefore churn prediction bad.  Are you a troll?
165,Software engineering. Data analysis & lots of related jobs which require some knowledge of databases  making tables & basic charts  but where the emphasis is not on modelling but understanding & explaining the data. Being a scientist of various types although that requires other advanced skills.  Edit: Some data analysis jobs can be paid well too  it's just more about communication & wider business discussion than the detailed programming & mathematics that a data scientist gets into. Obviously those are both ideal cases.  There are also jobs like being an actuary & presumably lots of analyst-type roles in financial institutions.
166,Do that many people actually use Bluetooth headphones? They're still insanely expensive (if you want a pair that sounds half decent) and they're just another device I have to make sure is fully charged every time I want to leave the house.  I just don't get why everyone is rushing to get rid of a technology that is by no means obsolete.
167,Just so you know  there are lots of great DB viewers you can use to browse and see data straight from your DB. Even for non relational DBs  they still look very readable and basically the same as a datasheet. Excel is absolutely a great program with awesome features  but it just feels wrong to me to count on it while programming anything serious. You shouldn't depend on something like Excel.
168,They come quite handy in practice. A useful application we found for graph related algorithms (e.g.  community detection) is in any sort of clustering. We used this a number of times for NLP tasks when looking for detecting frequently occurring concepts and related terms to those. While there are various frameworks you could use for this  I found the readability of a graph representation quite appealing and enabling discussions with less technical people. Of course this works best for cases where your nodes semantics are rather clear like words/phrases.  I found it generally a useful tool to reduce your problem to a graph problem  given their visual appeal and the rich literature of theory and (efficient) methods for various operations in graphs.  Translating your items/concepts to nodes and similarity between them to weighted edges is an obvious one that allows for various forms of clustering and distance computation. Note that you're free to use any distance function (e.g.  driven by embeddings) or even multiple definition of distance between the items.  Another interesting application we ended up using was using the graph representation for ranking items. In our problem domain we simplified the annotation task to pairwise comparisons among items  which is a much simpler and reliable task than assigning rating to items. By representing the result of pairwise comparison in directed edges  we could rely on efficient graphs algorithms  such as page-rank to define a global ranking among items from a sample of pairwise comparisons.
169,I'd say i got two great flaws as a GM. The first is that i use a lot of plot armors  more than i should and in some of my games it took away most of the fun because my players already knew they wouldn't die  which takes me to my second flaw  and to me the worst: I have a great inability to end a campaign or even continue it  normally they die after 4 or 5 sessions and the hype that me and my players had simply dies  it's not like we let it die in the first weeks  it takes months to we actually declare it dead  and this is something that is really making me take a time out of being a GM  but at the same time i don't feel like playing a regular character  I also got some minorish flaws like not describing the details of  mainly  scenarios  i only describe it when asked.
170,Pretty disappointing on the AMD side  even considering 290X slots in between a 780Ti and 980. Here’s hoping they blow these numbers out of the water this year.  Also  minor nitpick  “7870 Ghz” should probably be “7970 Ghz.”
171,There's a lot I wish I knew. Talking to myself:  * **There's like a billion different RPGs out there**  and you would love so many of them. Lots of them have really short rules -- even one page! -- and they're really easy to get into.  * **You don't have to do combat.** You know how much you love the story and glaze over when you fight stuff? There's games that are *just* storytelling. You can tell a hilarious  or beautiful  or gut-wrenching story in just a couple hours  no dice needed.  * **There's a lot of LARP that has nothing to do with foam swords.** It can be an awesome way to reimagine roleplaying  and no  you don't have to dress up.  * **One-shots aren't compromises!** You don't have to feel bad about not doing a campaign  it can be just as rewarding to tell small stories that you don't revisit later.
172,If they have a visualization service for their firm  using that is usually the best since they get longevity out of the report. But it might be difficult to get access.  A well designed PPT (with your branding in the header/footer) and all your supporting numbers in an Excel is an excellent option. This is typically useful for youngsters as well as the more experienced people in the organisation. Ppts are easy to share and widely accepted.   If you decide to go with a more tech savvy solution  also think about how you will disseminate the information. Does an app need to be installed? [Not very dependable that anyone over the age of 40 will be able to do this] Will you mail the link to all the stakeholders? If you need to update the visualization or numbers how will that be rolled out?

174,I ALMOST traded in my Fiesta ST for an e-Golf. I have a very short commute  we own a second car  I have a garage  it made a lot of sense. Ultimately I did not go through with it because...    There are none for sale here (rural new england). I was going to go through Vroom  but buying an electric vehicle sight unseen was just spooky to me.   Many mechanics will not or cannot work on it.   We can have weeks of <10 degree F weather and I just don't know how that will affect the battery in the long term. Like after going through 3-5 harsh winters hows the capacity?   Tech seems to be getting better rapidly. Maybe it's better to wait another few years.   And lastly  most of them look terrible. The e-Golf was the only electric car I could reasonably afford that didn't look like crap. i3  spark  bolt  leaf  all look terrible to me. Volt was okay but I wanted no ICE engine and Tesla = $$$$.    So I guess I'll stick with the FiST!
175,I have both the Fiesta ST and 6th gen Camaro SS 1LE. They compliment each other very well. For me  the FiST is mostly for the winter plus hauling large stuff with the hatch. Camaro is for summer and track driving. I love the Camaro on track and cruising around town with the LT1. But jumping into the Fiesta still brings a smile to my face  it's fun to drive on any road and extremely practical.
176,I'd find a B450 motherboard that supports 3rd gen Ryzen and then pick up a 3700x. The 3700x will outshine the i5 in nearly every application. If you don't feel like shelling out for the 3700x  then the R5 3600 will do great too! For the memory  look for 16gb of the fastest your board can run. I'd recommend 3600mhz  but 3200 will be great also. Hit me up with any questions  good luck!!
177,>AMD says that the Ryzen 9 5900X  at $549  is expected to compete directly against Intel's Core i9-10900K  which has an MSRP of $529.  -  >AMD expects that the Ryzen 7 5800X  at $449  is likely to be competing against Intel's Core i7-10700K  which has an MSRP of $409.  Huh? They're publicly targeting lower MSRP competing chips?
178,It's very long and the quality in the writing is inconsistent. If you search around the internet you'll find the reaction to it is mixed. If you want to give it a shot there's no reason not to  just see for yourself whether or not you'll like it.
179,I'm actually biased here because i watched FMA 2003 first and i will say it's because FMAB has a happy ending and follows a more conventional plot. FMA 2003 i think overall is slightly better but it fails in that its plot at times makes no sense lol and that things kinda just happen out of no were while FMAB's plot proceeds according to a structure.
180,Sure  you could. Not sure why you would want to  or if it would improve anything  but you could.  You could conceivably imagine some scenario where using L1 logistic regression on a highly dimensional dataset with many noisy features  then using some other model on the reduced data would be reasonable.
181,Sometimes using a different die system is less about mechanics and more about breaking players out of the thought patterns/routines they associate with different dice.    Call of Cthuhlu could have easily used a D20 instead of a D100 as it's base die for resolving checks  but I think by semi-arbitrarily changing the numbers it helped players break out of the DnD mindset and get ready to play a new kind of game.
182,"I see reviewers complaining about the lack of USB ports on boards often. The reality is that for probably 99% of users 4-6 ports is enough. USB hubs exist  and work well enough that you will not notice any latency or bandwidth issues. For all those who would say ""I could tell the difference"": No  seriously. You won't. Anything that isn't ""realtime"" like printers  scanners  disk drives  iPhone can be run off a hub on a single port.  I have my rig on the other side of my room and run an optical displayport cable and a single 5 metre USB A to Micro-B cable (a TetherTools one to be specific  it supports 5Gb/s over its length and is just a dumb cable  no extension chipset/signal booster) which runs into a TP-Link powered USB 3.1 hub into which is plugged my mouse  keyboard  headphone DAC  USB mixer for my mic/additional outputs  webcam  external SSD for music library  my monitor's USB for on screen controls  and my iPhone.  Hubs do a very good job of prioritising inputs and real time stuff like audio. I have never noticed any drop outs  latency or bandwidth issues  even when artificially maxing out the bandwidth by using a disk benchmark all through a cable which is beyond the recommended length for USB."
183,I've an opportunity to use a 20' x 18' room as a dedicated gaming room.  What are some functionally useful features I should work into my plan?  Assume the budget is generous. I know basic woodworking and may be looking to upgrade my skills. Also comfortable controlling LED lighting  motion detectors and other gadgets. Thinking about having changeable mood lighting depending on the game. While I'm open to any and all ideas  I'm particularly interested in practical  logistical considerations based on your experiences with gaming rooms.  *Edit: Although D&D is in our rotation  I'm not seeking a dark  dungeon-esque vibe. Thinking maybe something in a retro 80's-ish direction. Maybe?*
184,What about [The Sprawl](http://www.ardens.org/games/the-sprawl/)? It's a PtbA game (so  similar to CoM) fine-tuned to run mission-based cyberpunk games. It also can be used as a generic system for any homebrew world.
185,So I would like to get this question that I have had for a bit answered. Why is game development so expensive? As you can tell  I'm a beginner and cant seem to figure out why game development always seems to cost so much money. I know you have to pay for things like marketing and maybe licensed music  but other than that I'm clueless as to what makes the process so expensive.
186,Nice man. Enjoy that wonderful relationship with your dad. I don't want to be a downer but some people will never feel this - me included. Wish you and your dad very well  you've got a lifetime of treasures.
187,"Expecting players to propel the story. I like to give a sandbox and a few plot hooks then leave them to their hopes and dreams. Turns out 4/5 players have as much thought as ""I'm a fighter and I use a great sword"" and need neon signs to point them at something."
188,"US10773602 B2  Current assessed strength (30-40th percentile) - but that is based off of market  auto data mining of similar worded patents  and the individual companies litigiousness.   To me (work in tech scouting).. they may have something.. but I bet if someone copied it they would have good grounds to bypass this as it is pretty ""obvious"" to me.     One of the requirements for a patent to be granted  and be legitimate (and enforceable) is it needs to be non-obvious to someone skilled in the art.   &#x200B   But anyways    Since claims are the only thing that matters in a patent (the rest is just background)  &#x200B   ### Claims  1.

189,It’s good the MC is op and they there’s no bs like something holding him back or something and hell even if he dies he’ll come back it doesn’t hold back which many other similar anime’s do so it was nice and refreshing but also makes the story predictable so it’s good(ish)

192,Warning - I don't know 5e and I very much do not know the module in question  so I'm going to avoid all such bits of discussion here.  So this doesn't sound like a power gamer issue  just someone being a jerk with some slight murderhobo tendencies.  The later bit isn't a major issue  but the jerk-y-ness is indeed something that needs to be addressed.  You are very correct that this is best handled out of the game  rather than in character.  And chances of it  if nobody else has stepped up to do something about it  it may be up to you. But first - talk to the rest of the group  GM included.  Since you're new to the group  you may be missing some details about the group's general playstyle.  For all you know  the murderhobo-ism is acceptable to the rest  and everyone just ignores the warlock player's more annoying habits.  Or  you may be in agreement with the rest and something needs to be addressed with this problem player.  It sounds like the group has tried talking to this warlock player in the past  although getting a better idea of how extensive they've tried may shape how you see the group.  If they've tried a whole range of things and gotten nothing  you may want to consider finding yourself a different group - while everyone has their reasons for tolerating a jerky player  it doesn't mean you have to.  Good luck!
193,I am looking for a project where I could apply fairness AI  and was hoping to get some advice.  I know there are quite a few fairness AI techniques. Does anyone know what are the mainstream/common fairness AI techniques that people use now?  Also  are there any common datasets of a regression type where I could apply fairness AI?
194,This can happen when you want to create amazing things as a company. Of course its not what anybody wants  but I don't think a single person will look back at this time 2 years down the line and wish they hadn't crunched these last weeks. We should celebrate this company for being honest about it and recognizing that they're going back on their word as well as paying out the overtime (which isn't standard).
195,I am curious as to whether it would be worth my time to deep dive into deep neural networks or if traditional ML techniques dominate this industry.   Or perhaps there is a certain sector in Fintech that deep learning does have significant use cases. I am not familiar with derivatives  or HFT for example.
196,Honestly even parts with naruto and sasuke are weak. Whole boruto series feels like watching bad written wattpad fanfic and not even old cast makes it better. If you're not hard die naruto fan i really don't recommend
197,Not my favourite Zelda  would rather see a Mario All Stars style collection - OOT  MM  TP and WW!  Would even love to see ALTTP using the same engine as Link’s Awakening.   However  I guess as none of that seems likely  I’ll take Skyward Sword!
198,114% price increase for 15% performance increase. This doesn't bode well for what a possible cut-down 3080ti for $1000.   I know this is far-fetched  but could there be another die that they haven't revealed yet?
199,I feel like this is a simple issue  but I'm pretty new to all of this.  I'm trying to spawn squares into my scene in random positions  which I managed to do. However they spawn on top of each other  so I figured I would add the randomly generated positions to an array and then check if it already exists before spawning the next one.   Don't think you'd need my whole script  but let me know.      Vector2[] spawnPos       randX = UnityEngine.Random.Range(-2.5f  2.5f)      randY = UnityEngine.Random.Range(-4.8f  4.8f)      whereToSpawn = new Vector2(randX  randY)    Also  currently the objects just continue to spawn  I'm looking to limit it to a certain amount in the scene before de-spawning the earlier ones and replacing them.
200,Them trying to somehow capture the monster without killing it sounds like a more interesting combat than a just a regular monster fight so why not let them try if they get it in their heads that that’s what they want to do?  If they manage to capture it maybe they will come up with a way of saving the monster (or putting the woman’s spirit at rest or whatever) in a cool way and you can actually let it happen. Or maybe it was a futile hope all along. Either way it could be an interesting story.
201,Hi everyone! I have developed an educative game called “Logic Gates” which aims to teach logic and logic gates in a fun and interactive way. Everybody can understand and complete the educational levels in which you learn the basics of logic and experience with logic gates in an interactive simulator. After learning the basics  you can solve the puzzles which are more challenging problems. If you are already familiar with logic  you can directly try to solve puzzles. Also  there is a sandbox mod in game where you can create your own logic circuits and gates.  If you are interested in mathematics or computer science  you should **definitely** play the game because logic is the most fundamental topic of those areas. Here are the links:    [https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/mantik-kapilari/id1533790336?l=tr](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/mantik-kapilari/id1533790336?l=tr)    [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeremOner.LogicGame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeremOner.LogicGame)  I would be glad if I can receive some feedbacks from you.
202,"I really like the BMW 2 series. Its a ""proper"" compact executive sedan. Audi and MB only have FWD offerings in that size - which is disappointing for people like me who don't have anyone else in the car 90% of the time.  I'm happy that BMW are rumored to not be going the direction other manufacturers have in their next gen model.  I seriously wanted a 2 series - but I just couldn't have another coup and the 2 series didn't have the tech features I wanted."
203,Should've just linked to the [subreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/j1ccfq/game_ready_driver_45655_faqdiscussion/) the post is based on.  Oh wait  you can't share threads to r/hardware. *sigh*
204,Fantastic ideas  great style! The inspirations you cute are some of my favorites  and I've long wanted to run a game that draws on their themes and aesthetics. This really tickles that craving  although I might mix in a little more weirdness and surrealism  maybe borrowing some elements of Lacuna  Over the Edge  and Welcome to Night Vale. I'm surprised at how down to earth the Last City feels apart from the Shapers - even the Society seems almost more like an oddity than a fantastical intrusion. The effect is unexpected and intriguing!   If you don't mind me offering a suggestion  I think it might be beneficial to include some factions or roles that would lend themselves to a party of PCs. The adventure hooks are varied and flavorful  and some of them could easily turn into whole campaign hooks  but some of them get me wondering what sort of people would get drawn in. I can easily imagine a team of scoundrels for hire  like in Shadowrun  or intrepid investigators based out of the University  but I'd love to see what your imagination could produce along those lines.   Do you have a blog or anything like that? Do you have an interest in hearing about what people do with your material in their own campaigns?
205,I always find myself making mistakes. I’ve been working at my first real job since May of last year  and I just can’t seem to improve this. I always end up making mistakes like forgetting to correct some formulas and producing incorrect values because of it  or not looking at the data in a more appropriate way. Now I feel I feel I’ve lost credibility and people are not going to take me seriously. No matter how much I try to check and double check what I have  I always seem to miss something and make some errors.   I am more better at building something than checking numbers. For example  I can build dashboards  queries  troubleshoot  even ETL loads  then analyzing data and looking at the numbers from an analytical perspective. Not sure if I explained myself well here.   Don’t know what to do except conclude that maybe this field isn’t for me.  [UPDATE] Always respect janitors!  [UPDATE 2]  Thank you for the support  advice  and tips you all have shared.
206,"DS practitioner here I""ve built a high end gaming pc two years ago  after a few months of using amazon ec2 for deeplearning workloads (computer vision).  Main reasons i disliked ec2 were slow data transfers and very high costs - Gaming PC cost was equivalent to about 3 months of EC2 invoices.  Another big advantage of on premise machine is that your data is always with you (i work for a private company so we cared about that).   I'd suggest you get a beefy i7 with as many cores as possible  an overclock certified motherboard (you re not going to do that  but they re generally more reliable)  a top tier PSU and 64+ gb ram.   As a side note  I went for an 1080ti + i7 8700k that at the time outperformed every ec2 instance i have tested in typical tensorflow vision models training."
207,Remember than in many practical applications  a simple robust model will often be just as good  if not better than some complicated model. What is actually rather hard is to create everything around the model like data pipelines  preprocessing  visualization  etc in a way that it fits into the BI or ERP landscape. You should focus on your skills of bringing a model into production. The best model is useless if you cannot get it to work within the productive system.
208,"I'd like to nominate the [Vizor Role Playing System](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/327241/Vizor-Role-Playing-System) by [Crenshupiter Networks](https://www.crenshupiter.com).  Vizor is a soft rules role playing system that is designed to be simple and quick to learn  while allowing for dynamic gameplay.  It is setting agnostic.  As a kickstarter backer  I had the opportunity to play a one-shot DM'd by the creator  and our party had a fantastic time.  Vizor is oriented much more around role playing and collaborative story telling than it is about combat.  Min-max gamers may find themselves a bit confused in the system  but a DM can adapt the rules to accommodate players from more rigid systems such as adding point buy or other constraints to character generation.  Another approach is to have consequences or side effects of having excessively high or low attributes.  In our game  the DM said ""with a Presence [i.e. Charisma] that high  you will have difficulty moving quietly around the city while you are surrounded by suitors"".  The game mechanic that I found most fun was influence cards: Using a basic deck of cards  each player is dealt cards which can be used to alter die rolls in your favor by explaining how one of the character's resources (e.g. a special weapon  item or NPC) influences the outcome.  This has its most dramatic effect when a player uses a King to accomplish the most positive and flamboyant outcome for a check - the player gets to take over the narrative and has their moment to shine.  Vizor is a great system for pick-up games  for inexperienced roll players  and for those who love the theater of roll playing.  It probably isn't a good fit for those who love the detail and structure of more complex systems."
209,D&D (and to a similar extent Pathfinder) is often the entry point for RPG players  and people often prefer what they know over what they haven't experienced yet. That's why it's not hard to find a D&D game -- and why it's hard to find gamers for other RPGs.   Mind you  I'm NOT saying those folks are making the wrong choice! If that's what they want  more power to 'em. But yes  I've found it's hard to recruit non-D&D players for at least the past 30 years. (Sorry  I'm getting old.)
210,RuneQuest. It has the same BRP rules as Call of Cthulhu and many other games. But the setting  Glorantha  is the real draw. Everyone has magic. All myths are true. Ducks are a playable race (think Howard  not Donald).  Free quickstart and sample scenario: https://www.chaosium.com/runequest-quickstart-1/
211,Rhapsody of Blood is a PbtA/Legacy game that's a mix of Castlevania and Bloodborne (with a dash of Darkest Dungeon).  The players are explorers of a cursed castle  seeking to slay the reagent that rules it (and maybe get the holy grail that powers the castle's magic... which comes with a price  of course).  A great rules-lite system for those who want to do a megadungeon without all the trouble of making a map  and a good boss fight system.  Sadly  it really helps to read over its parent system  Legacy: Life Among the Ruins 2e  because RoB is pretty barebones.  There's also a modern-day version of Rhapsody  Voidheart Symphony  which is basically Persona 5 (without the ~~stands~~ personas)  and is much more fleshed out than RoB.
212,I wouldn't prepare a string of plot points like that  I'd just prepare a location/situation. Something like the settlement with noted guard locations is good  but rather than plan out a carriage chase I'd just put a couple carriages in the settlement somewhere. Maybe the players set off no alarms and get off scot-free  maybe the players burn the whole carriage house down as a distraction.
213,Hi everyone. I am a recent graduate working at a large insurance company. I have been considering a career change and have a couple of questions.  How much of a coding background do I really need to get an entry level position?   What should I look for in potential master’s programs and/or employers?  What is the interview process like? I’ve heard they may ask you to code on the spot...   I am considering applying to grad programs in Europe (specifically Spain) due to the outrageous cost of college in the US.  My family is concerned that employers here won’t like a foreign degree on my resume  is this true?   Background: I have a B.S. in Applied Math. I took Python  R  and Visual Basic in college but don’t have much real world experience using them and they were all level 1 classes.  I really like the work I’m doing as an actuarial analyst (especially if I get a chance to do something in VBA) but the exams are just not for me.  I ideally would want to get a job working in the entertainment industry or at a “creative” company doing something technical (e.g. spotify/apple music  some media company  etc.)  so any advice for getting those types of roles would be greatly appreciated! TIA
214,It depends. Are you doing the work yourself or is a shop doing the work?   That’ll be a big financial difference. The other key point is time. If you’re doing all the work yourself  how much “extra” time are you dedicating to making these repairs and has that impacted your daily life life being with the family  work  etc.?
215,"There's a similar issue with web design. Replace door with ""button"" or ""menu"" and it gets crazy.  That's why conventions exist though  we have 30 years of game design to learn from. You'd be crazy to try and make a triple A game engine from scratch  just like you'd be crazy to redesign every known game mechanic.  Guns are fired using mouse 1 / right trigger. Space is jump. ""Play"" means the game is beginning. A gold star is good. A bomb should be avoided. Falling off the map will kill you etc.  Indie Devs push the boundaries of new mechanics. Triple A's stick with what has worked in the past."
216,Only 3090 has the Nvlink connector and it's for synthetic benchmarks and some compute-alike usages. Most/all games since long time don't support SLI/Crossfire officially which then either make it's not usable or just random.  DX12 allows using multiple GPUs without SLI/Crossfire but that's something that needs to be implemented at a low level in a game engine.
217,"> sometimes people will DM me saying how much they enjoyed the session and how much they like my GMing style and everytime I see a message like that my anxiety shoots through the roof.  The reason for this is that the feedback you are receiving is non-targeted and general which comes from a good place but can actually be *discouraging* because it holds little to no constructive value. Something as vague as ""I really liked the session"" can ring very hollow because it ultimately says very little and can be easily seen as disingenuous. It might be a good idea to nudge your players a little by asking them what parts they especially liked and what you perhaps could have improved on. If they have difficulty answering explain to them that while the compliment is nice it actually makes you a little anxious because something as rounded and immaterial as that can be a little hard to take at face value. and could easily and mistakenly be interpreted as ""I didn't have anything that really kept my attention so I'm just giving a vague compliment to be nice."""

219,Hi  Everyone   I am applying to Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals masters programs. I have a bachelor degree in electrical engineering and have been working solely in the IT industry since graduation with 10 years of experience (Software Engineer  QA Engineer  Test Automation  SDET) in various companies such as aerospace  speech recognition  and data analysis.  I am very interested in data science. But looking at the programs at John Hopkins  there are two I am interested in:  1. Masters of CS specializing in Data Science ([Link](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/computer-science)) 2. Masters of Data Science ([Link](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/data-science))  I have some fundamental understanding of the difference between them. while CS is more theoretical with less emphasis in python  while Masters of Data Science is more practical  and from the course structure  it puts a certain amount of emphasis on math and statistics  and use more python.  I have also read elsewhere that there are also differences after graduation  when you try to apply for a job  that in the industry  at least for now  Masters of CS is more recognizable than Masters of Data Science  as the standard in education in data science is still not 100% set clearly yet. And also a Masters of Computer Science degree seems to be much broader and would open more doors  not just limited to Data Science.  Looking at the course structure  I found both are very interesting  one seems to put more emphasis on software and development  while the other more on mathematics.  I am wondering if anyone could shed some light on those aspects:  1. Career opportunities 2. If the program is well defined 3. Recognition by the industries 4. Salaries 5. Anything you can think of.  and any inputs are greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
220,Can someone share the some preorder bot scripts so we can at least have a level playing field?
221,I don't understand the question. If you're asking how rare it is to find one in mint condition  low miles  and one owner...then very rare. People don't usually buy new cars to not drive them. Especially if they aren't exotic or premium.
222,>The arbitrary index values that have nothing to do with the data  df.append(Series) duplicates index values by default unless you add ignore_index=True.  The data is being treated as immutable by pandas until you specify that you want a change. Having it automatically reindex is very dangerous so this is in fact a very sensible way to handle merging of duplicate rows/values. It's up to you as the person who handles the data to 'make it nice'.  >.loc? .iloc?   location  and location by integer. Read the docs seriously it will start to make sense if you develop a habit of doing that when you get confused.  > but is the syntax in trying to get away from!  This is like saying X programming language is hard  so I'm going to shop around for a new language. That's the wrong way of thinking. Tools are widespread because people have found them useful and have built on top of it and you are going to have to adapt to that. Or maybe just write your own library?
223,First off  my players range from 7 to 10  and we will be playing over the internet.  I have a home-brew Halloween adventure planned: A low price/amazing quality Halloween store has popped up in town  Cornelius Crumb's Cursed Costume Corporation  and unbeknownst to it's customers it's wears are as advertised.  More details: A halloween costume/decoration store pops up in town  Cornelius Crumb's Cursed Costume Corporation  with amazing price and even more amazing quality.  It's an instant success.  Everyone is wearing costumes from and decorating their lawns with Cornelius's creations.  Halloween night dawns and it turns out Cornelius's wears are as advertised... cursed.  The decorations all start coming to life  and the costume's become real  slowly brainwashing their wearers into becoming the characters they were pretending to be.  The kids are racing against time to break the curse which becomes permanent at midnight. The adventure includes a Troll's Toll Bridge Riddle/Puzzle  festively themed neighbourhoods (some spooky  others silly) come to life  saving throws to maintain their sanity (with comical consequences like having to speak in silly accents) and a final confrontation at the lair of Cornelius Crumb.  I want to include candy  possibly to help combat the curses effects  and other fun halloween things.  Any ideas?
224,I may be in the minority here  but I've yet to hear a turbo 6-cylinder from Porsche that sounds good to me. On top of the relatively unpleasant tone  they seem pretty quiet as well. Engine/exhaust noise is one of the most important factors to me in buying a car  as it's a huge part of it's character  and that alone would keep me from buying a turbo 6 Porsche (not like I could afford one anyway).   On the other hand  the 4.0 in the GT3 is one of the best sounding engines I've ever heard. Their V8s sound pretty amazing too  especially in GTS and Turbo form. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the new Panamera Turbo sounds.
225,"Excellent video by Steve  I agree.  Its really funny how things evolve nowadays.  Igor has a (at the time) valid theory  although he might have worded it a bit strongly in his german video at least (he said something like ""It was immidiately obvious to me that this is very likely a capacitor issue""). Nevertheless he explicitly stated it as a possibility.  Then JTC picks this up and states theory as fact (at least thats what I gathered  I do not watch his videos). At this point in time you could already see that Igors theory is just a theory  because of the many reports of MLCC capacitor cards / mixed capacitor cards also crashing. Jay did not care or (worse) did not even research.  His video gets the attention of nearly two million viewers  and many of them hop on the bandwaggon of power filtering design problems.  Then der8auer hops in with his soldering skills and real life testing and comes to the conclusion  that with mixed caps you can get your 3080 overclock around 30 MHz higher  but it really has no influence on stability at stock clocks.  Around this point GearSeekers notice that there are no issues with this cards when using Linux  pointing very strongly in the direction of driver issues.  Then nVidia releases a updated driver and seemingly all problems are gone.  I think Igors way of journalism is fine. He seems to have electrical engineer knowledge and is cautious with his claims. I would not fault him for his theory here  although -- as I said -- I feel he was a bit too confident in it.  In regards to JTC  I have to say it went as expected. I was flabbergasted when I noticed today that he has around 5 times the amount of subscribers compared to HU."
226,My guess is that they will use this acquisition to start imbedding their GPU technology and machine learning tech into arm based chips. so my hunch is Nvidia will give a boost to Arm’s neural chips and its GPU development. and then in the future they will license  the option to implant arm chips with Nvidia GPUs baked into the chip instead of arms current Mali GPU/ machine learning cores.
227,I wonder what anime your friends like that make their tastes not-shit. Anyway  here's my (slightly outdated) top 25:  1) Love Live! School Idol Project/Love Live! Sunshine!!  2) Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  3) K-ON!  4) Soul Eater  5) Barakamon  6) Little Witch Academia  7) Ouran High School Host Club  8) Gurren Lagaan  9) Monogatari series  10) Mitsudomoe!  11) Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya  12) Princess Principal  13) Handa-kun  14) HitoriBocchi  15) Sword Art Online  16) Tokyo Ghoul  17) Konohana Kitan  18) Silver Spoon  19) Pokémon  20) Hinamatsuri  21) Oreimo  22) Kino's Journey  23) Fairy Tail  24) New Game!  25) Hyouka
228,Overnight lows of 38-39 will be fine. Just be aware when you start out in the morning that even in the 40s that you won’t have maximum grip and that they’ll take extra time to “warm up” (and even once they get some heat you still won’t get maximum grip).   Extended time below freezing?  Different story.  Realistically if overnight lows are 38-39 that’s not the same as the tires sitting for weeks of sub-freezing temps.
229,The basics are probably function calls  but when the inputs are all dataframes  you cant really output them to a file. What do you do? One idea I had was to   maybe set up a file somewhere with a list of keys for some small subset of the data points  and only print that subset of the dataset for each function call. This has the added benefit that if one of the values doesn't make sense  it's easy to stick the key in the file and see the trace of intermediate computations. I was thinking of possibly implementing a python decorator for this  but it seems tricky as it's tied to the structure of the dataset you're filtering.  Any suggestions about useful things to log? Or advice on the filtered log I mentioned? Thanks!
230,Light is a character who constantly works on his plans till they are as perfect as possible.    Lelouch doesn't work that way  his plans revolve around breaking down the plans of his opponents.      So  as you can see using their plans and actions to compare both characters isn't going to help understanding who's smarter because they work very differently and worked in very different environments. Intellectually they are probably the same.      If you want to go for a 1v1 however it'd probably be Lelouch  Light tries to make the best plans but as Death Note has shown it doesn't always work out. Lelouch on the other hand focuses on breaking through his opponents plans and I don't think he's faced a single tactical defeat in the show.
231,Thanks for the helpful post. I know there’s a good coding standard to follow and I will shamefully admit that I also contribute to the 99% of code that is poorly written. What is the best way to learn and making good coding standards a habit?  Is it also always true that more ML focused roles are closer tied to profit generating initiatives in all companies? Or would this be much more dependent on the company themselves?
232,I don‘t know if it was ever released outside Germany  but take „Ruf des Warlock“ in. It took the tables of rolemaster and the crunch of the old „the dark eye“ and math that was nearly algebra. But the world was cool  dark and metal (if you know manowar you would find many references in the world). But the rules made it unplayable.
233,My friends and I created group / club on FB dedicated to anime culture  and the reason why I'm posting this is to ask you guys   what kind of content we can provide people because I don't want it to be cringy and boring. Thank you in advance
234,Yeah  I can see the hackers pruning up those bots for the extra supply.
235,"I just brainstormed for a bit and the answer is no which is why I ended up with a 48"" CX.  We've gotten higher luminance and refresh rate but PQ has been almost stagnant.  Since 2017 there are still only 4 legit HDR capable monitors and these are literally the only displays pushing PQ forward. As a result  they are out of 98% of people's price range (X27  PG27UQ  X35  PG35VQ)."
236,Yesh  basically train a new ensemble model using the other models as features.... But this can overfit quite easily if you're using data that was used to train the earlier models. Will you have access to the output of these models on actuals which weren't used as training data?
237,As someone that spent a great deal of effort to land a 3080 FE without paying scalpers  Best Buy is the worst vendor to have exclusivity.  Their site completely crumbles on every restock  and they have zero interest whatsoever in limiting scalpers.  I had a 3080 added to my cart 5 different times  every one of them the website would break during checkout.  I am in a telegram group with hundreds of others trying to land a 3080 and everybody has echoed the same issue.
238,"For people that have never seen it: A Place further than the Universe is a fantastic series. It starts off seemingly like a ""cute girls do cute things show""  but underneath it has a very strong ethos to it and an actually heartfelt story as well.  The audience-POV character Mari starts off as a teenage girl that thinks she is wasting her youth by not having done anything really interesting during it. One day she meets another girl  Shirase  whose goal is to join an expedition to antarctica  as she is unwilling to accept her mother's disappearance during such an expedition a number of years earlier. Mari decides to join Shirase in this project. The two girls need to get some money for the expedition  the acceptance of the organizers  and their parents approval  and along the way they find some additional friends. And then of course there are the difficulties of the journey itself.  The show is great and has some good theming  discussing family relationships  friendship  and life-purpose. And it's really  really good."
239,Sorry if this seems like a dumb question. I'm not familiar with FPGAs and recent rumors of AMD acquiring Xilinx has made me wonder if it is possible for an FPGA to automatically cache and accelerate frequently run instructions of a CPU like how a memory cache would store frequently accessed bits of memory used by the CPU?
240,The Grand Sport trim becomes FR Corvette exclusive thing. We would never see Grand Sport again.   > Total system output for the new E-Ray is expected to be around 600 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque  with electric juice sourced from a mid-mounted Ultium battery pack. The E-Ray will also sport the same widebody treatment as the upcoming C8 Corvette Z06.  If this is true  I feel E-Ray could take many original C8Z06 buyers.
241,I'm not sure what you're talking about with the G35. It was literally the car that saved Infiniti if we're talking about generation 1.  EDIT: VQ35DE is a pretty solid engine. There plenty 200-300k miles examples around. For 2003  the G35 had a great interior. Every magazine claimed the G35 to be a Japanese BMW 3 Series. I'm sorry but it really bothers me when someone posts something stupid and inaccurate just because it's cool to hate on Nissan/Infiniti.
242,I graduate from UT Austin with an MS in Business Analytics this may. A lot of the courses look similar to the ones that I took during my degree. I think it looks like a solid curriculum and I think they are focusing on the right areas  as far as data science is concerned. One thing that I wish we had more of was foundational classes like a few of the ones that are in the MSDS. The MSBA had more industry specific classes  like finance and supply chain  which also have their pros and cons. But  I was pleased with my experience at UT as a student  so I would think that the MSDS would treat you well.
243,Massive improvement inside and out. I'd still say the interior looks 1/2 notch behind competitors  but it's so much better. Jaguar's management finally realized their cost-cutting ruined their image  and have ventured back into their classic wood/leather/metal philosophy.  Unfortunately at this point the XF is what it is. The majority of consumers don't even know it exists  and for those who do this is too little too late.
244,It's cool  but I feel like it would need to be hundreds of thousands to really make a difference right now.  Luckily  the slow drip will eventually satisfy most of demand. I hope that I'll be able to pick it up in a few months without any issues. My 1080 is still holding okay  but I'm looking forward to doubling (and even tripling in some cases) its performance.
245,looking at that list I'd opt for Mouse Guard next  just reading it myself at the moment and it's a lovely little game  not too hard to get your head around and has some interesting ideas that set it apart.  one other thing  if you. haven't already and could be bothered  it might be worth grouping all your games into families (pbta  FATE  forged in the dark  whatever Free League call all theirs etc).   there will be a fair few where once you've got the hang of one  you'll breeze through several of its related titles (or know to avoid if you don't want to keep retreading ideas).
246,"I think you may be butting up against one of the great ""invisible walls"" of world-buidling  and one of my greatest challenges  which is the border between logic and explaining everything versus magic and mystery.  Finding the balance  and/or the ""pressure points"" where something needs to be fleshed out and explained  versus something that needs to be shown but only hinted at or not explained at all  is very difficult for me to keep at the forefront of my mind while creating worlds. It's intangible and elusive  but I get the sense that it is crucial for the end result and for the reader."
247,The title means nothing if you dont know which field you're going. If you enroll into Data Science program  it'll be a broad discipline.   The most paid field is finance. The most prestigious is machine learning(IMO feel free to disagree). You can also work in public service but it will be a sweatshop job running models and simulation for specific government body.
248,[ECS P4S5A  Socket 478  SiS645](https://www.cnet.com/products/ecs-p4s5a-motherboard-atx-socket-478-sis645/)  Was for Socket 478 Celeron  Pentium 4.  Total pile of trash  throw it away.  It has AGP  PCI and the weird looking slot that everyone is confusing for PCIe is actually an AMR slot  used for soft modems and sound cards (Crap modems and crap sound cards).  Interestingly takes both SDRAM and DDR RAM (But not at the same time).

249,My dad was a research psychologist for most of his career  and he became severely disenchanted with his field over the course of his career because nobody knew how to run experiments properly and would consistently misuse and abuse statistical methods (looking at you  p-hacking).  I was influenced enough by this that I decided that if I were to do research  I wanted to have a strong math/probability/statistics background so that I wouldn't make the same mistakes. Then through that I realized that coding and exploring data for its own sake is more interesting than most of the applications  which lead me towards data science.
250,I wouldn't let that stop you from buying a car you really want. Unwanted attention will obviously happen sometimes with any car that isn't an everyday commuter car and especially if it looks a bit sporty... but that shouldn't force you into driving a Camry just to avoid it.  )

252,I think it's a good thing that those shows can have such an effect on you. It just goes to show the power that art can have on someone that it can instill such emotions in them just from a mere memory.  I mean  it's been about four and a half years since I last watched K-On  and I still tear up just by listening to Tenshi ni Fureta yo  the song performed in the final episode. Hell  sometimes I feel like crying just thinking about the song. But that just goes to show how much I cared about the show  about these characters and the time they spent together  and at the end of it all I'm glad that the anime was able to make me feel this way.
253,So WuKong dark souls type thing?  Unsettling fur graphics on the face  I can’t even read the puny tiny teensy weensy web site address on my iPhone XR in widescreen mode at the end card to look into this more so that’s an oversight
254,Death note. I started seeing anime last year  when everyone in my friend circle saw death note. I am happy I saw it  even though I didn't want to at that time. Death note got me hooked to anime. I saw Stein's gate next  and then Mirai nikki. Love anime right now  and I guess I won't be stopping anytime soon.
255,They're very blunt about their opinions. If it sucks it sucks it sucks if not it doesn't. Biggest issue with these reviewers is most of the time these people only have at most a week with the car so they aren't able to form a full opinion or know issues. Also remember they drive all kinds of cars.
256,"To add to the ""job title doesn't matter"" theme. The company I work with does contract work for the government. Some contracts require job classifications and time records.  Often job titles have important contract implications  so people will get titled according to what works out best for the company. This means job title doesn't reflect what anyone actually does.  So just ignore job titles. I put my job title on my CV to be whatever best explains in one or two words the kind of work I actually do."
257,Yes there is a difference. Haven driven the old RWD LS400 daily for years—slowly most of the time—every time I get in a FWD car I remember how much different it is.   Even sitting still. The placement of the pedals  firewall  windshield. The height and length of the hood. The shape of the dashboard. The whole things just a different animal.   And once the car is moving? Lots of subtle differences at any speed. Even if the average driver can’t express or understand them  I imagine they still notice in their own way.   Even driven slowly the old LS400 is clearly no FWD car. Doesn’t act like one  sit like one  feel like one.   If there was no difference except in performance driving  a Lexus LS wouldn’t have had roughly double the MSRP of an Avalon for the past 30 years.
258,Hey everyone   Was wondering if I could get some advice. My XPS15 9560 used to run like a dream  it’s almost 4 years old and it can hardly run FL studio. The battery is completely dead so I have to have it plugged in at all times. My question is  will replacing the battery solve my performance issues? It can’t run any of the video games I like to play anymore
259,They've all but confirmed the Series S runs at a lower settings level vis-a-vis their announcement that it won't enable One X enhancements on games that have them. If it doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of last gen  you can be sure it won't have them all for this one.
260,"I wish.  (during character creation) ""PlayerX  tell me one thing you know about the character to your left."" ""Uuuuuuhhhh...""  (in town) ""So  is there a shop somewhere in this new town where you can sell all your jewels you can't pay with?"" ""Uuuuuuhhhh...""  (in dungeon) ""Ok  which direction do you want to take? Left or right?"" ""Uuuuuuuhhh...""  I love my players  but interactive they ain't. (Guys  if any of you are reading this  I'm exaggerating. You don't groan for *nearly* as long.)"
261,Be proud of what you achieved & stay humble  )  There is always a bigger fish  but in case of your competition there are probably 90% smaller fishes who you were competing with  ) - So yea it is definitelly a thing to be proud of - gj :)
262,Ethernet is the best for speed and reliability  but if you dont want to thread cables  one option thats not wifi is ethernet over power. Basically it uses your electric wiring for ethernet  and can be decent  if the the wiring isnt terrible.
263,"It depends:  If you create backdrops and the scene is relatively small it would work if done in Maya.  We typically break down objects if we come to a point where the scene expands and...  - objects are re-used in a modular way (building blocks of the game world  like ""prefabs"" that are often used in Unity) - more and more objects are combined with other elements (lights are placed outside/inside buildings  individual collision or triggers are set up per building/interior  audio is placed per building  etc) - some objects move via a script or timeline and it can't be one large static object  - the scene gets so large that we start setting up LODs (switching to versions of meshes/textures that take less GPU time and memory at a distance) - we create a large scale world and need to break parts of the world down into pieces"
264,If it’s backwards compatible with all my games and saves and downloads  I’m far more likely to buy it sooner rather than later. I’m not a budget gamer  but I tend to play games 6-12 months or more after release because I just don’t have time. If I could upgrade and be able to get the rare brand new game that I want  like demons souls or ratchet and clank  but also be able to play all my current games  I’d do it.
265,Tonikaku Kawaii: After watching the second episode  I decided to read the manga. This is too adorable  watch out for the sugar rush.  Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibouken: Lol  this is good. Dai and his friends deserve a lot more love from the community.  Danmachi: It still looks nice and entertaining  I'll see it through to the end.  Jujutsu Kaisen: I like the design  the action and some comedy moments. It may be the best anime of this season.  Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou: It was nice to see a renewed version of Kirito  maybe this is a nice love story.  Akudama Drive: I want to see more of this show.  Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou: I never saw it  I don't know what to expect from this after reading many comments  they don't even agree if it's a remake or a sequel.  Ikebukuro West Gate Park: I think it won't be the best anime  but good enough to want to keep watching.  Other shows like Noblesse  King's Raid and 100-man left me cold  and I have doubts about continuing to watch or dropping. I left Munou na nana  it was not good.
266,I was working as Devops at a company  and saw that there's too many noisy alarms.  Everyone on my team was getting alarm fatigue and I wanted to do something about it.  I had a background in math so I started looking into how I can apply my math knowledge to help the team.  Then I found an article that applied ML in IT operations and got interested in the field.  This led to more and more projects and as I pursued the field  I became a data scientist.
267,School Rumble: Funny show featuring fun characters at school.  Slayers: Fantasy setting with fun characters & a good story.  Aria The Animation: Slice of life  with a very beautiful setting.  Read Or Die (OVA): Action  cool characters  and a great soundtrack.  Rocket Girls: Cute girls doing cute things  and they go to space.
268,"There are some things that are easier in R  but I personally find some things are vastly more difficult. For example  anything having to do with types. R has a ""class"" and a ""type"" neither of which really matter because everything is a vector and trying to coerce a date-like string into a date object only works half the time.   The error messages that R produces often feel like they are deliberately as useless as possible  so debugging is a chore.   Dictionaries practically don't exist  trying to use them just seems futile.   For the record  I have more of a math background than a CS one  but learned python before R."
269,It'll probably be remembered as such and that's fine  but my personal opinion on the anime is different.   It's not a bad anime and the world is great  but I genuinely really dont care about the 3 *main* characters. I personally find them all to be very one dimensional and boring  and find myself caring more about the side characters and their stories.
270,Just like many basic life  skills  it will be absorbed into other disciplines like business  engineering  social sciences  psycho  as basic skills   just like it's been used in epidemiology for decades.
271,This stays funny. However the spider lady gave me that Orochimaru vibe  hella creepy lol. And what was she doing with the cat lady  aka hater  it almost sounded like rape or something similar. I will stick around for this anime  never thought climbing could be this fun.
272,For a well sorted AWD car with suspension adjustments to dial out any factory understeer  the biggest answer is actually going to be the added weight of the AWD system.  Most of the understeer people bitch about is there by design and small modifications such as stiffer rear sway bars can significantly change that without much drama. Physics still exist  but most plowing understeer experienced at the limit is typically due to the suspension geometry decisions more than AWD vs. RWD.
273,You are under estimating both Software engineering and Data science. Both require tremendous amount of work. Your statement is like saying you want to be both a cardiologist and a neurologist. It is not possible. Please choose one based on your aptitude   give it your best in that field.you will surely reap great successes by this focused approach.
274,Changing the colour of leather is a bit of a mission and it almost never looks good or the way you want it  even when doing it with white leather. Then there's the issue of the dye getting on your clothes for months afterwards and fading.  Other than looking in a junkyard for cheap replacement seats or getting them reupholstered your only real cheap option is covers like LJ-Rubicon said. Just make sure they're the furry leopard print ones so that people will respect you.
275,"Its so hard to tell because there are too many dream cars. If i could choose just one i would maybe go like ""Doesnt matter  one of them"".  They are all at 1st Place for me  even if i start with the Vette.  &#x200B   1. Corvette Z06 C7 with Square Rear Pipes 2. C63 Black Series / Stock C63 Facelift Coupe with BS Body and 5.5 Biturbo V8 3. E92 M3 as a track tool with Cage  huge wing and a front lip 4. RS6 C7 with Klasen Single Turbo and Darwin Pro kit. 5.

276,Oh yeah  big time.    I've run games for people for about five years over multiple systems and settings and I find it hard to ignore the sense of guilt I feel at having wasted their time.  The odd thing is that they have all been humouring me all this time  thanking me for running the games  discussing their favourate bits sometimes years later  and encouraging me to run games again.  They are either really self-sacrificing and have the patience of utter saints  or really enjoy watching watching me make a fool of myself and are great at keeping a straight face/pretending to have fun.  I've not decided which it is yet  but I'm almost sure they can't be genuinely having fun...
277,You mentioned three times  “not enough product/customer facing experience”.   In academia  you’re delivering a solution for a fine tuned problem. Hey  maybe it might be a model you have to deploy  but key word. Fine tuned. Here  the priority is accuracy.   In business  you’re developing typically for customers. you’re building a product that millions of people will interact with at some point. The key priority here is: stability and reliability.  The difference in academia  majority of the things you make will never touch millions of people. It might. But not likely  and if so  it’s for a very specific research question. Companies don’t want this. That want a well tested  reliable and stable system that’s 1) easy to understand  2) works the way you want it 3) works 90% of the time. This is a completely different ballpark.   Familirise yourself with tools like docker  kubernetes  and understand your advanced skills in ML aren’t the highest on the food chain.   The best way to feel this is in a smaller company. It’s a completely different feel to research.
278,I don't see how MLP would work but I think 5e would be good for transformers and even better for G.I.Joe.  both are combat orientated and G.I.Joe agents entering a cobra compound is basically a straight up dungeon crawl. I also think an HP system fits well as transformers and G.I.Joe are expected to take a beating and keep walking.
279,That’s because these folks have a very limited view of what data science is. They’re obsessed with machine learning  even though it’s just one of many tools. Here are some others which require plenty of math/statistics knowledge to use properly:  - Simulation - Optimization - Time Series Analysis - Regression Analysis - Survival Analysis - Bayesian Statistics  - Design of Experiments
280,Definitely 10-15+  most traffic I see on the interstate goes up to 10+ or more. I set my hard limit at 15 over unless it’s in the middle if nowhere then the fastest I’ll go is the 2nd fastest car in the pack  it’s like a free spotter to eat up any speed traps ahead. I think I read somewhere that speed limits are set by the 85th percentile of the speed that traffic flows at.
281,"Are there going to be lower-end models as they had with the previous generation? I might need to built a computer for Solidworks and Keyshot at some point  but the high-end pro cards are too expensive. I also don't yet fully understand what types of work really demand a ""pro"" card and when a typical gaming card will suffice. It's for professional work but I'm not sure whether it really needs a Quadro type of card. I think it's going to be mostly CPU rendering  with the GPU used for rotating the model and stuff like that  pre-rendering."
282,One of my takeaways here is that the 5700XT was priced very competitively for what it was. While Ampere gained almost double the price-to-perf of Turing  it only gained 13% more FPS-per-dollar over the 5700XT. Ampere should be beating RDNA1 in value as part of its generational improvements  but it's impressive to see the 5700XT retain good value against Nvidia's latest  even before RDNA2 is announced.  Those who bought the 2070 Super last year also got a sweet deal  even as the RTX 3070 is coming to replace it.
283,Post-apo survival on different planets. Based mainly on thing like fallout  borderlands  no mans's sky or stalker. I have a bit of a problem  i dont know how much of these games i can legally use  if anyone knows  or wants to know more about the game  pls let me know.
284,Multiple users actually have the same numbers  but the likelihood of two encountering each other is unlikely. The number system seems to have been purely added to circumvent the html style name hacks not long after the game released.   The purpose of the numbers will be only to give a somewhat unique identifier  but not actually unique. As you said  the game has millions of users and giving people a number of 6 digits would end up with a while other kind of name problem.
285,Depending on whether you like watching the OP's and ED's for each episode when you binge watch  you can generally watch 5 episodes in 2 hours  thus the divide by 2.5 rule.  That means it would take you approximately:  * 5 hours to watch [Bloom Into You](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37786/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru?q=bloom%20into%20you&cat=anime) (13 episodes) * 10 hours to watch [Vinland Saga](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37521/Vinland_Saga?q=vinland%20saga&cat=anime) (24 episodes) * 20 hours to watch [Cross Game](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game?q=cross%20game&cat=anime) (50 episodes) * 30 hours to watch [Bakuman](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7674/Bakuman?q=bakuman&cat=anime) (75 episodes) * 40 hours to watch [Space Brothers](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai?q=space%20brothe&cat=anime) (99 episodes) * 60 hours to watch [Hunter x Hunter](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011?q=hunter%20x%20hunter&cat=anime) (148 episodes) * 378 hours to catch up with [One Piece](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece?q=one%20piece&cat=anime) (945 episodes)  Was this post also secretly a ploy to get more people to watch Bloom Into You  Vinland Saga  Cross Game  Bakuman and Space Brothers and to consider making the plunge on Hunter x Hunter and One Piece?

286,Mostly it's paying for salary and benefits for a team of highly skilled people. Let's say you've got a team of 10 people  their salary on average is $75K/year now  the total cost to employ someone can be up to twice what their salary is  so... $150K per person per year  that's $1.5 million per year  spend a few (3\~) years on the game... that's $4.5 million. And that doesn't factor in any other costs.  For a solo individual indie dev  the costs of developing a game aren't really that big  mostly it's just needing to survive during the development period and having and keeping maintained the tools and equipment needed to develop.

288,A shame that emissions are killing JLR engine lineup. While the XE can get away with 4cyl turbos only  I'm not as convinced buyers of the E-segment would be happy with only a 2.0L as the only choice. Heck  Volvo at least gives the option of the T8 PHEV as the range topper.  No wonder the next generation XJ would likely be more of an I-pace sedan than another silky V8 involved.
289,Thanks for this breakdown. I was trying to do some information gathering myself. If Igor is right and the lack of MLCC groups on some models is the cause then I wonder whether or not there will be some kind of recall. Not sure this could be ~~fixed~~ helped with drivers. I've read undervolting and underclocking the GPU's can help  but at that point the hardware isn't meeting the spec's it was sold on. The whole situation is pretty awful.
290,Hello everyone. I was hoping for some advice in dealing with a problematic member of my team. I began working with this person a few weeks ago  at first I was quite happy because they're cheap and they work very dilligently. However  it's becoming increasingly apparent this person doesn't work very well others. Here's some examples.  The other day we were discussing how to design an interface. I had an idea for a design and tried to pitch it  but my teammate didn't like it for a certain reason. I made some suggestions to make it work  but they turned me down every time because my idea didn't fit to their design. I felt very discouraged  like I was begging for them to use my design. In the end  they yielded  but I called them out on this and they didn't think they did anything wrong  they were just arguing. I tried for about 10 minutes to make them realize what they did wrong  but they just couldn't understand it.  There's other things that mildly bother me  this person also assumes I'm going to agree with them in a lot of things. Usually they're right  cuz their ideas are often more efficient  but sometimes I don't and that usually causes trouble. They once asked me to do a complimentary task for their work and I told them it was too technically difficult for me and they completely ignored me.  Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this behaviour? I really don't want to lay off this collaborator  they work very well and I've already gone through a lot of setbacks in my project. Thank you all very much for your time.
291,I STILL don't understand why the hell people are so offended by this! Just wait for more to come on sale  they're making more  it's not a limited product  they'll make millions of them still. People really have no patience these days  so desperate to buy a brand new thing. I bet the same people complaining shit on people that buy Supreme products lol.
292,"Interesting review so I have both the GT4 718 and a M2 Competition  I spend a lot of time on Hockenheim too  the M2 is however nowhere near stock. My M2 is what the M2CS should have been  so:  Seat delete  Inside delete (Car is around 80kg less there)  Lightweight Exhaust ab Kat (with opf though)  200Cell Downpipes  M Perf Suspension  Aero  ProTrack 18"" Cup 2 Wheels (295 rear 265 front) AND finally lightweight battery. Pagid racepads  cooling  motil race brake liquid and lines. I post the cars on https://instagram.com/trackunite?igshid=1kxlm7vp5bm1d   I disagree with you on seating compared to the GT4  the seating in the M2 is the worst sitting position ever  even worse than my M140i  the M2 seats are too high and they need a tad more side support  ideally more bucket.   Confirm on throttle review  now with my tune the engine is alive like hell from the heavens  i can only recommend more breathability on the turbos as it spools up way faster and makes it much much enjoyable. The engine wrecks the GT4 in straightline speed  way more useful powerband and it keeps up with GT3s (not RS)  The turning in is one big issue thats easily solved with tyres and suspension  so what I have done  HOWEVER the car is incredibely sensitive on out of corner throttle input  it always wants to turn on you  ive nearly binned the car a couple of times where it just wants to throw you out in M traditional ways (sideways)   Brakes are standard Blue  they work fine without a passenger and bring consistancy  was at RedBull Ring they struggled a tad there but otherwise its good. More performance could be better.  2 crap factors on the car - Seating and the fact that when the tank is at 1/3 fuel it cuts out in corners as the Cup2s make so much gforce the engine starves of fuel  wtf right?  Otherwise I must say the m2 with this setup is by far the best track setup car one can have at a decent budget  its not cheap  but honestly  i could bin this car into the wall  and what it would cost me to repair would still be wnough to crash it again and then its the price of the Gt4 which by no means is faster in every single way. Price to Perf is crazy and can only recommend.  Reliability - Differential is fucked  goong to be updating it to a motorsport one  transmission is perfect  engine too. Suspension too  but I have a a million of weird sounds coming out of the car at the end of a trackday. This is where the porsche wins  it never gets tired  a M2 does.  PS O.P. DM me lets link up and chat. Always good to have trackbuddies"
293,I'd say get a second look at it by a mechanic  Like others have posted it looks like surface corrosion but cosmetic... with that being said it isn't GOOD to have this rust on your car but it doesn't necessarily imply flood damage  Does the car feel damp inside? Moldy? If it stinks inside then it might have some mold which is dangerous
294,>NVIDIA will no longer be adding new SLI driver profiles on RTX 20 Series and earlier GPUs starting on January 1st  2021.  Instead  we will focus efforts on supporting developers to implement SLI natively inside the games.  We believe this will provide the best performance for SLI users.    >Existing SLI driver profiles will continue to be tested and maintained for SLI-ready RTX 20 Series and earlier GPUs.   >For GeForce RTX 3090 and future SLI-capable GPUs  SLI will only be supported when implemented natively within the game
295,I wish I was one of those people who was selfless but all I do is stay at home. I mean  I don’t expect to get anything for doing my part but definitely not enough to get one of those shmexy Miatas. I wonder if you can option them  like if one of the front runner selfless people got an MX-5 from them  and it was manual  what if they can’t drive manual? Or what if it’s an auto and they would prefer it to be manual or whatever? I don’t know but I hope they can actually option it so that it suits them

297,Zoomers don't covet Japanese cars like millennials do because Japanese cars aren't the answer to the tuner scene anymore. Back in 2003 the WRX had a 0-60 time of 5.6 which was fucking bonkers. It could completely take a Mustang GT off the line. Now in 2020 the WRX has stayed the same while the Mustang has gotten twice as powerful.
298,This winter (Canada) I'll have an attached garage and a winter beater  and I'm looking forward to keeping the summer car away from the rust-inducing salt on Canadian roads.  Rather than winterizing my summer car  I thought it might be easier and better for the car to take it for an occasional drive when the weather is nice and the roads are dry  to keep everything lubricated and moving. I have a set of winter tires  so grip at low temperatures is not a concern.  My questions are:   1. How often should I aim to drive? Once every 2 weeks? 4 weeks?   2. How long should I drive it for? A 15 minute trip down the highway to get everything up to temperature? Or just fire it up  and roll it around the block once or twice?  Thanks in advance!
299,to be clear im not looking to hire or be hired at the moment so this shouldnt violate the rules. im just thinking about potential costs for a male voice actor. if i were to have them do  say 50-200 lines for a horror game. what would be an estimated price to charge for it. theyll likely just be one character
300,Everyone's mentioned infotainment touchscreen/voice command/etc  but here's how the main physical controls could be made utterly awful.   The throttle and brake combined into one pedal. Push the pedal for throttle  pull it back towards you for brake. Obviously  you'd need to strap your shoe to the pedal to be able to brake at all. And it's for your left foot  with your right foot operating the horn.   The steering wheel is replaced by a rotary knob  and combined with the gear selector. Push it in for drive  pull it out for reverse  leave it centered for park.   The signals  wipers  and everything else can be either voice or gesture controlled.
301,Needs a “/s” here and there.   Honestly  excel is a victim of its own success because in its ubiquity among most business savvy types it also garners scowls and scoffs by a number of fresh programming oriented data science grads.  What you end up getting is Frankenstein software like ALTERYX that satisfies both parties to a degree but overcharges at crazy high margin.
302,Hello  I've been looking at a 2017 chevy bolt but I live in an apartment in Austin  TX with no garage to charge it in. Do you have any advice a situation like this? Is using charging stations like gas stations a bad idea?

304,Based on *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX*'s unique drawing style  we can use Shader Graph to make two shaders: one to draw an outline around a mesh  and another to make the object appear like it's being hard-drawn with a two-frame sketching animation.  You can also read it here:  https://danielilett.com/2020-10-09-tut5-11-urp-mystery-dungeon/   Thanks for watching! 💙
305,The cpu performance drops as resolution rises because crysis uses vertical fov.  So draw distance goes up at higher 16:9 resolutions above 720p. An og trick to get 60fps in original crysis is to use a 4:3 resolution for 4k or 2k (2880x2160  1440x1080p) without scaling   which means black bars on the sides  but no additional drawcalls.     This new version will run above 60fps at all times on medium at 2880x2160  if this review is accurate on cpu usage.
306,Treat it abstract or ask your pc's. 1. Have them locked up or captured and make them rp the escape. 2. Pc's create a unified backstory along with personal 3. If these one shots are in a series use loose connections to a place or set of npc's. Had a few written up that connect to The Blue Moon Inn as an end point  a meeting or a discussion of which tied things together. Or everyone knows Bob senario 4. Have Pc's rp some bs about how but give them vague clues or ideas  5. Revolve a minor plot point around how they know each other. 6. Mystery  only one player knows the others and confronts each with a piece of info that connects one to the others  conspiracy style.

308,What are stickers for?  On race cars they are advertisement for sponsors.   People putting them on street cars are trying to imitate the race car look. It's not really that different than nonfunctional aero bits.   I got bunch of CF aero bits on my car because I just like the way they look. But I wouldn't put stickers on my car despite being in the same category of useless modifications.   This to me just proves that judging car modifications is a silly concept to begin with.
309,"*Should* is a difficult word to use when prescribing animes  any of it involves your's or whoever else's time  and often the best/most worthwhile animes take a while to really reach their stride. I think [One Piece](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece)'s writing (or at least  its best story moments) beats out any other anime's high points  but it takes around 200+ episodes to even get to that point. Just to nitpick.  [Inferno Cop](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16774/Inferno_Cop) can be finished in about 45 minutes and happens to be one of the best animes I've seen  I think everyone should try watching that. Otherwise  a lot of it comes down to personal preference and shows that are specifically good for their genre. [Cautious Hero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38659/Shinchou_Yuusha__Kono_Yuusha_ga_Ore_Tsueee_Kuse_ni_Shinchou_Sugiru) (12 episodes)  [Hellsing Ultimate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/777/Hellsing_Ultimate) (10 50-minute episodes)  [Gurren Lagann](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) (27 episodes)  and [Persona 4 The Animation](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10588/Persona_4_the_Animation) (25 episodes) are some fairly well-rounded picks and are all of manageable lengths (if we're going for a ""you're stuck on a deserted island with 5 blu-ray anime discs"" type of scenario.)  Hope this helps  or is at least interesting or relatable  lol. If you've heard of any of those shows before or if you end up checking any of them out I'd be curious to hear your thoughts  and hope you find some good shows!"

313,So I know Python  R and SQL but I’m noticing that employers are asking for SAS. My previous understanding was that SAS was more akin to Stata and SPSS as opposed to a high level programming language like Python  is that a mistaken assumption?

316,They probably figured it's cheaper and more effective to only loan their cars to youtubers/influencers  since most of them are pro-Tesla anyway. Old farts petrolheads from car magazines often lack the naïve Tesla enthusiasm of teenagers and millennials.
317,From what I've seen it's more that the market is realizing the way to generate real ROI in data science is by scaling the insights from data. And software is the best way we know to scale data science. So it's becoming increasingly important for a business to not just be able to apply a model to data to derive some novel insight but to also scale that model by deploying such that it can be integrated with business processes and/or existing software applications.
318,If the 20.7Gbps was just before benchmarks failed  it was alread ECC'ing. Wouldn't be surprised if 20-20.5 performed a smidgen better.   Still  for an overall 2-3% improvement  the extra 5-10% power draw is probably not worth it.
319,It seems like to a degree gougers are inevitable. I wish they'd use a release price premium (maybe markup 50% for the first two weeks before slowly going back to MSRP based on supply?)  that way at least the money is going into NVidia's pockets instead of some dick with a webscraper on the internet.
320,I'm currently 21 so I'm a young driver. I absolutely love Japanese cars and for all my life basically wanted to get my license so I can get one. The 240sx (both the Kouki and the pop up headlights) is one of my favorite cars of all time and the Silvia S15 is my all time favorite Japanese car since we never got them in the US. I grew up playing Need for Speed and with the Fast and Furious movies so I'm sure those played a part. Over time I learned to love all types of cars  no matter where they're from but there's too many great Japanese cars not to love. In Southern California  mid to late 2000s was when you'd see all types of Japanese makes from G35s  350z  240s  S2000s  MR2s  RX8s  STIs  IS300s  and occasionally mk4 Supras and RX7.   These days while many people have transitioned to WRXs  GTIs  and the much improved pony cars  I still love older Japanese cars. Old 70s/80s Celicas are are beautiful cars  Datsun 510s are the poor man's Skyline GTRs. I currently have a Honda Civic and its solidified my love for Hondas to the point where I plan on keeping a Honda in my garage at all times in my life (ideally alongside a more comfortable  practical European car). Maybe its because I'm not of the financial situation yet to be able to afford GTIs  WRXs  or Camaros  but I love easy to work  cheap to run Japanese cars
321,I know we all want an AE86 or an m3 to fishtail around in but I'd be working with my daily driver. (Obviously would do some engine work to build it past stock specs) Is it the right type of car? Is it practical? Is it more trouble than it's worth?
322,It is a cliche anime but the power of friendship was explained as an actual power in the anime and also he was fighting the hero so it does make sense. The power of friendship was not as vague like some shonen  anime.

324,If you are asking about if the original manufacturer can do this then yes - both Porsche  BMW and Mercedes off restoration through their 'classics' programs. If you have to ask how much it costs then you cant afford it or even know if they would accept it. Really depends on the make/model/year as well.   Otherwise you are taking the car to independent and having it restored or buying one already restored.

326,I’m in a bit of a similar situation (in the US right now and trying to advance my career)  and have been doing “informational interviews” with older acquaintances in the field to try to figure out whether or not I need to return to school  and in what. It sounds like you might have connections from networking that you can contact about this  and imho they could probably give you a more in-depth answer.  And I guess the short answer I’ve found so far is that it seems to depend on what type of work you want to be doing  and what kind of company you want to work for 🥴
327,Like many people my age  I played Zelda games a lot as a kid (90s)  grew out of them  and re-discovered the series in my mid-late twenties.   I missed this game and pretty much all of the other GameCube/Wii titles. It is expensive to buy them for those platforms  and I would love the chance to play them all on the Switch. Get on it  Nintendo.
328,"Hey   This isn't a dumb question  especially if you don't know what an FPGA is. But as others have mentioned  this isn't a possible use case.  You have probably seen or read somewhere that FPGAs are ""reconfigurable hardware""  but this really only tells half the story.  A simple way to see an FPGA is as a mesh (or grid) of small components called LUT (look up tables). These LUT have the nice property of being able to create any (boolean) function when several of them are linked together.  What this implies is that given any hardware circuit and a big enough FPGA  it is possible to find a pattern on the grid that will behave exactly as the described hardware. So you can in fact reconfigure your FPGA behave as any hardware  hence the term ""reconfigurable hardware"".  But there are some big catches here:   - For a given circuit  its implementation on an FPGA will be a lot slower than its dedicated hardware. So you cannot speed up a task inside the CPU  because the dedicated implementation (i.e. what AMD currently has) is a lot faster.   - Finding the right pattern on the FPGA to behave as the hardware is a long process  and the equivalent of a compiled for an FPGA can take days to find a result.  This is why a lot of ideas that you might think are possible with FPGAS are in fact practically not feasible unfortunately. There are also other reasons which are linked with data movement  but I won't talk about them here (this is a problem shared by GPUs by the way).  For the record  Intel bought Xilinx's concurrent Altera years ago  and it didn't change much back then  so it is unlikely that AMD buying Xilinx will bring revolutionary changes.  Regardless  good luck with your work."
329,Of course it is possible to find different publishers who only get the rights for one specific platform. Most publishers would prefer to manage all the platforms though. But a deal where they only manage a single one isn't inconceivable.  But if *you* were unable to get your game through Apple's QA  then a publisher might not be able to do that either. It might be better to find out on your own why exactly they rejected it and fix that problem. Yes  I know. Apple doesn't make it very easy to find out which rule specifically you violated and what you need to change so you get past it. But publishers do not have some magic wand which can make those rules disappear either.
330,Your nerve system reacts in 30-50ms. The electrical impulses from your brain to your fingertips and from your eyes to your brain is only moving at 430 meter each second or 460 yards a second. So that is why u get burnt if you touch a hot stove. Human Lagg. But seriously i think 2000fps is magic number.Maybe u react a nanosec faster than 1000fps.
331,"I'm struggling to understand here. So progress in GPGPU performance is *far* exceeding progress in CPU performance (""Huang's Law"") ...so Nvidia is *obviously* going to exploit this by buying a CPU design company?    I've no doubt that there is a more complex story to be told here re the ARM purchase. It's actually pretty easy to think of a few good ones. But whatever that more complex story is the article absolutely does not tell it."
332,"So I don't have any specific resources I use for my interviews. But they've fallen into three categories  1. Programming heavy. These interviews are similar to software engineering interviews but the questions aren't nearly as difficult. I've gotten some questions about tree algorithms (BFS and DFS.) I've also been asked to code matrix multiplication by hand.  2. ML Heavy. These are more along the lines of explaining ML algorithms and how to use them. I've gotten asked about the variety of differences between boosting and bagging  ensemble algorithms  neural networks  etc.  I've also been asked design questions  which are supposed to test how I would go about planning a solution on the spot. These might require understanding how to go about manipulating data and displaying you know how to ask the right questions about the data. One question was identifying the similarity between two sets of tokens and they wanted a simple  non-deep learning answer.  Some of my interviews have asked me to present either past projects or the take-home assessment. Regardless you should be able to clearly explain hypotheses and methodology for what you've done. Be ready to answer the question ""What would you do if you had more time."""
333,I seem to be having trouble with my download speeds when using any browser on my laptop. The download speeds seem to be capped at 500 Kbps. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad L340. It’s only 10 months old.   I’ve used other devices to download the same files  but the only device that seems capped is my laptop.  I know it’s not a network issue as I have (theoretical) 300 Mbps download speed. The laptop is even connected to Ethernet through one of my Google WiFi points.   There seem to be some anomalies  however. Steam games download just fine. I can even game most of the time  though  I do lag considerably when I’m gaming  in a Discord call  and have a YT video playing in the background all at once.  Can anyone help troubleshoot the problem? Warranty runs out in a month  so I’m considering that as an option.  Edit: forgot to ask for help lol
334,I have been playing and GMing since the days of the Holmes boxed set of D&D.  Over the years I came to realize that my biggest strength is improvisation  in all its forms.  I was a semi-professional storyteller for more than a decade (libraries  schools  etc.)  which helped me to develop my natural improvisation skills quite a bit.  Since I run sandbox games where the characters can pursue whatever things they want to  it helps a lot to be able to adjust things on the fly.  I just build the world  populate it with stuff  and then turn them loose in it.    I'm good at worldbuilding and helping shy people get more involved in the sessions  too.  My biggest weakness is that I have a hard time remembering specific rules when they get past a certain level of complexity  so I end up having to use a lot of rule cheat-sheets.  Luckily I have a player right now who has a very good memory for such things  but isn't a rules lawyer type  so he is my walking reference book.  :)
335,There is a guide to this in the Monster Burner I believe  Maybe its in the Adventure Burner  not sure if it made it into the codex. Basically they don't care too much about balance  but if you add skills you Add just a few core skills  not every possible skill the life path gets. You kind of balance traits points with skill points. And don't be afraid to throw some negative traits in there.
336,I don't know the language and I'm stupid and do other stuff while watching anime so that I need the dub to focus. I also prefer games in English instead of Japanese so I'm happy that Genshin has an English dub
337,My poor 1070 deserves a rest. Its been 4 long years of maxing out gpu usage  and my stable overclock has been getting lower and lower. Im still mulling over getting either this or the 3070  itll really end up being a snap decision at 8:58am tomorrow.   Rip EVGA 1070 SC.  Annnd I didnt get the chance. I refreshed the page  sold out instantly. Never even got a buy button.
338,Is this breaking nda?  He probably doesn't have an nda because it's provided by maingear.  This is super interesting to me.  No mention of sponsors by NVIDIA  only maingear...  I think this is a major maingear fuckup lmao.  60fps at 8k is pretty cool.  Drops to 50 at certain points but at 8k  I don't know how much it's getting bottle necked by CPU.
339,Within unity player settings  under quality I believe  there is a setting to determine the maximum number of pixel point lights that I redact with a surface. Try moving that number from 1 to 2. This may cause performance issues though depending how the rest of your scene is set up.
340,I expect too much of my players. I assume they'll put in the same effort into their characters as I do into setting  story and NPCs. I also expect them to make the logical leaps I see as easy.  I try to mitigate the last by allowing them rolls to use character abilities to make those connections and leaps.
341,I have the Scoche magnetic mount and it's mounted (with tape) to an empty spot on my dash  right next to the vents.  I know some people don't like the magnets (requires a case or a sticker  prevents wireless charging  can mess with GPS signal  etc) but I like the convenience of being able to slap it on there without having to finesse it.  Although  ever since I got a car with CarPlay  I've never really needed to mount my phone.
342,Let me tell you about the Hamlet of Reckstead  a patriarchal feudalist democratic anarchy. 923 people live there (more than half of them half-orcs)  ruled by their Prime Minister Spork Gork  an overweight female goblin with a wild  unkempt beard  who is moderately successful despite the rampant sexism. Among other notable characters in the village is her mentor  the (former?) Prime Minister  Shump Gultch.  The people work the land  in exchange for working their lord's lands. Trade is mostly free  but with some taxes  which is the direct reason that people live a destitute existence. Despite this  there is barely any healthcare  education  or any type of help from the government. Instead  both prime ministers are getting a healthy 5 gp salary per day.   There are a healthy variety of professions in the temperate mountain hamlet. For example  there are 46 peasants  a blacksmith  a bartender  13 clergymen  a pimp  a singer and a choirmaster  a prince  a viscount  a drug dealer  a ship's captain  six sailors  a wannabe pirate  and seven grave robbers. Just to give you some examples. 56% of the population is out of work which does not include the drunkard  the two prisoners  or the squatter.  This is pretty neat. Well done!
343,We are creating an 2D game in Unity and are not sure how to approach character animation.  We were thinking something along this: [https://ahr-ech-blog.tumblr.com/post/138120962188/im-home-sick-from-work-today-so-it-seemed-like-a](https://ahr-ech-blog.tumblr.com/post/138120962188/im-home-sick-from-work-today-so-it-seemed-like-a)  As you can see the author has split the character into 8 parts and are manipulating them by rotating  squashing and stretching. Okay sure. But he also wrote:    ' The whole thing is driven by a sinewave behavior overlaying the movement angle and speed of the player object. '.  We dont know what this means and a google search for sinewave behaviour leads us to nothing.  Any ideas?
344,In this video I'll show you how to scatter and simulate 3D objects into game levels.  The Physics Painter experimental node in Houdini is really useful  but it can be a pain to select and import lots of 3D meshes.  Here's how to automate this process with a little bit of VEX and Python inside of Houdini.  Hope you find it useful for your projects!

345,The  [**Jose Portilla**](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/)  courses on Udemy are also quite good IMO.  The ability to pause is what is key for me in online learning.   In undergrad  if a topic went over my head I would just sit politely until the end of class.   Now I can pause  watch a few other videos on the same topic and then rejoin once I understand.    There were many 1 hour lectures in grad school that took me 3-4 hours to get through.
346,I'm currently developing my first multiplayer game (UE4) and will need servers and databases  however I know nothing about servers. My service of choice is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Are there any useful resources like books that can help me get a better understanding?
347,For new grads in any field  the answer is always:  Step 1: get a job  Step 2: learn how to learn (sounds like you’re well equipped here)  Step 3: find a mentor  I’m not trying to be snarky but you sound like someone who hasn’t really worked a real job yet. You’re starting at the bottom. If someone hires you  it’s because you’re capable. Work at it  don’t ask too many questions  but never be afraid to ask for help.  Unpopular opinion: No review of school material is going to help you get better at your job. The only way to do so is to do. Practice.
348,Just today  when my computer was starting up  I noticed it took longer then expected. When I load into my computer  some icons /in task bar) are invisible but if I right click them it sasys what is it. Then I noticed that mt E: drive was missing. I found it in the ''Quick access'' tab and it has a blue question mark on it  I can't open it  and my PC can't find it. What's going on?
349,"The one ring RPG based on the tolkien universe.  The characters martial skills are based entirely on their cultural background. (Elves generally learn how to use bows  and dwarves are better at fighting in tight spaces) Very low magic setting  spells are things like ""carve a small figure out of stone  if anyone enters the radius  the carving falls over and makes you instantly aware.""   It's very tolkien though  so theirs nothing like oni or kitsuni. It's basically Viking age simulator .   Its got a DnD version  but not sure how that one works."
350,It’s kind of hard to define plagiarism in DS or where to draw the line. It’s kind of a “you know it when you see it” situation. But in your case I would say no you’re not  since I assume they’re just small building blocks that you’re stacking together to work on an original idea/project. If it’s a large block of code or someone else’s script  then maybe keep it in a separate file or method and cite it in there.
351,I thought these types of posts were banned now?  In any case: this is a non-news. Lexus had more cars on the lot  so they sold more cars. If not for the pandemic  the Germans would continue to eat their lunch.
352,If this was a thing it would be quite interesting  it seems for the most part xbox upperhand in this upcoming generation is the power house that is Xbox Series X. While Playstation seems to have the upper hand in exclusives. So it may seem reasonable to just purchase an xbox one which will probably be cheaper and have the same games as the xbox series x for the first year. (I'm not saying one console is better than the other console wars are stupid)
353,Yes  granted I'm mostly searching through online forums/discords.  Make an ad for D&D: you get 50 applications in one day.   Make an ad for anything else: after a week maybe you'll get 3. If you're very lucky  2 of them will actually show up.
354,You could potentially just use plain ol' TFIDF and classify off that. To be honest  5000 sentences isn't that much data. If you run some feature selection off the TFIDF matrix  you might reduce dimensions inherently by getting rid of unimportant words. But I don't think you'd really have a problem with a dimensionality of 5000 words with some regularization on your model.  Doc2Vec or Word2Vec averaged might also get you where you want  since you could probably embed a sentence very easily with pretty low dimensionality depending on the domain.
355,I am thinking that maybe i would stay with Widows but i would definitely search it out well about what software from Linux could be used or integrated. We know that they worked beautifully together with the old game system. I would definitely recommend using
356,"To answer the question everyone is asking: Phil Spencer tells @dinabass that Xbox plans to honor the PS5 exclusivity commitment for Deathloop and Ghostwire: Tokyo.

357,The whole Toyota offroad market has surged BIG time lately. I don't know if its COVID related and people just want to get out of their cities and explore or they just are buying things that last because of uncertainty.  I just sold a 2014 Tacoma with 140 000km on it for 34k. Brand new it was $36k  granted it had a lift and tires and a nice stereo installed but usually aftermarket parts don't add much value...  I got lucky and found a 04 GX470 from some old people who didn't really know what they had but kept it nice. Paid 11k but all over the GX offroad forums people are having troubles finding them under 20k in nice shape and low mileage. These things are desirable as heck right now.  Landcruisers in general are climbing steadily  as with FJ's.
358,"This is pretty much what *Fate* prides itself in doing: Take any setting you like - preferrably fairly weird - and use their (somewhat) generic resolution system to play out adventures. ""Aspects"" inject the right tone and tie it all together.  If the standard fantasy skill system they provide is not to your liking - and not easily adjustable for what you have in mind - give *Fate Accelerated Edition* a look  which switches those to the more narrative and even more generic ""Approaches""."
359,Theoretically you could keep allocating textures of various sizes and looking for the [GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Error) error  and infer it from that  but that seems really hacky and bad. There's got to be a better way.
360,"My experience  anecdotal of course  is that there are *statistically* a lot more threads opened by R users asking why they should/need python rather than python users opening threads about why they're being asked to learn R.   So  maybe learning how to learn ""pure programming"" allows you to learn problem solving outside of your toolbox?"
361,Of course there was the concept of balancing a game to be exciting. I don’t think that is what people usually mean. There is clearly less focus on security and perfect balance between players in the group. There is also a different presumed expectation PC’s will survive.   It’s quite telling if you just look at The ‘Example Of Combat’ in the DMG (p 71). Not only do the characters in the example group range from lvl2 to lvl 5. One of them dies in the encounter.   All the random encounter tables for are categorized only by terrain and not to power level of creature. Why overland travels were dreaded so by players at the time. It was expected that you’d be just as likely to randomly stumble on a dragon at level 1 as at level 10. Where dungeons and other intentional sites  just as you suggest  were meant to be predictable and balanced to be a challenge the party could handle. They chose it after all. It was no ones expectation that all PC’s return alive though. In fact the presumption was often that maybe half the party would.   It doesn’t need to be said that they had understood that a balanced challenge is more fun than a walk in the park or an impossible task.   But there are clear differences in attitudes and it doesn’t share the obsession of perfect balance in every aspect of things with later editions. Nor did other roleplaying games that came shortly after in that time. (No powergamer would pick anything but a Noldor Elf in MERP for example)  I don’t disagree with your sentiment that they pitch for a balanced exciting challenge.   I do think you are in some sense attacking a straw-man here though. I think there are very few who mean that.
362,I've always been a car guy since I was a kid. A mixture of toys like hot wheels  lego  and movies/shows with cars. It never died away. My father was a car guy  but was never as die hard as me. If my current career didn't pan out  I definitely would have ended up in automotive engineering or be working at a mechanic shop.
363,I'm making a 2d game and I found an artist on Behance to help me upgrade the looks of my characters. The characters are already copyrighted by me through the official paperwork in the U.S.  The artist is from Vietnam and upgraded them to a more pleasing design but they still retain the looks of the original character.  I want them to upgrade my other art but I spoke to r/COPYRIGHT and they told me that technically I don't own the character fully and that I can't really use it.  The reason this is a big deal is because the characters are going to be a big part of the marketing.  My question is should I continue to hire this person or should I just find an American artist?   &#x200B   Has anyone else outsourced their art and then used that art for marketing purposes? 
364,"Yes! Valventia.  Basically a world made of broken worlds and dreams that fused together after the collapse of all planes.   This massive world was shifting and changing for millenia with people living as nomads because if you made a house today  it could be a mushroom  a monster or be 10km away next night.     Valventia would be the first city to exist in the part of the world the PC's lived their childhoods and was settled in the middle of rubble and ruins of multiple cities that coalessed together on the side of a deep lake (the docks are actually sunken walls of a dwarven city).    Within the city lives a man that claims to be alive since the time of the old cities  remembering how they tore the veil of planes and how it was life back then.   This man created within Valventia a gigantic Library and within it a guild of adventurer's to map and retrieve lore from the old world.    Basically the adventure would be a ""put tugether"" ideas of a world  where each session a player could create it's own piece of the world and add it to the map  with it's lore and interests that could be one-offs or used later by him or another player to make an arching storyarc.  The idea of build a world with whatever ideas and making all into a single piece that makes sense is something that I like a lot  but being able to keep it making sense and the general labor of coming up with lore and ties to these places makes it hard to convince my groups to do it."

367,A pc is written off in 3 or 4 years depending on the business.  A personal pc is written off when you feel like you need a new one.  However  people who build their own pc usually swap parts when needed  most often only a new videocard is needed to continue using the pc for another 2 years. (As long as you don't want bleeding edge 24/7)  People who only use pc's for word or youtube can easily reach 5 years before any part might give trouble.
368,Whats it like driving a cammed manual car?  Background: Currently swapping a cam into my 2014 Corvette with a 7 speed manual transmission. Everyone i've spoken to says that i'm gonna have to drive it completely different and that driving a cammed manual is way different than an automatic or a normal manual. Any insight?   Just don't want to damage anything from my previous driving style!

370,LSDs can be very expensive. 2-5 grand  unless you're doing the gear setup yourself. For canyon drives  I'd say it's not worth that kind of money. For track use  an LSD would help  but again  is it worth it? It's probably good for a few tenths  depending on the track. If you're not competing for time  I wouldn't spend that kind of money. Save that dough for better tires.
371,Hey! I'm Italian as well  so be free to write me in Italian if you don't understand something.  I checked the github and I think that this is a good starting point. You are showing your Python skills and the fact that you are enjoying it and putting effort in the project is a good sign. Let's say that this kind of Descriptive Analysis is useful at the beginning of a project.  Now  you need to work on Machine Learning  if that's what you are interested in. It's a vague question  so I'll simply recommend to look around  explore some models  try to understand what you like and dislike. Personally  I used Codecademy (it should be free for students for three months) in my free time for training my Python skills with ML  I think it's an useful tool.
372,Forget just the system. Even mentioning play-by-post will slow applications to a crawl. I'm as done & beyond DnD as the next guy  but offering up a super-convenient  asynchronous PbP of even games groups are clamoring to play seems to send those same groups running. Such a shame.
373,This is a pretty common criticism of WoD games.  They tend to devolve into action-oriented games rather quickly.  As others have mentioned  they tend to be viewed as goth flavored superheroes rather than monsters.  I can speculate about a few reasons for this:  1.  Horror is only effective when the horror is at least partly unknown.  In WoD games  the characters ARE the monsters and everything has been revealed in clinical  even obsessive detail.  It is hard to maintain horror when all the cards are on the table.  This is part of the reason horror movie franchises tend to degenerate towards action/comedy with each installment.  2. WoD demands mature  introspective players who are willing to focus on the character’s internal conflicts.  This is a big ask  especially for inexperienced players.  The fact that most games emphasize combat means RPG players come into the WoD primed to think about gaming in those terms.  3.  Combat tends to become a resolution when circumstances are otherwise unbearable.  Werewolf naturally emphasizes this more than Vampire because every Werewolf is a raging combat demigod.  Vampire’s convoluted politics tend to get to the point at which somebody is willing to resort to murder.  Once that happens  it naturally sets off a chain of revenge killing.  4.  There is no RPG on Earth that manages to consistently evoke horror.  There are rule mechanics that *simulate* horror  and you can create anxiety in the players.  However  the abstract nature of the gaming and the level of disconnect presented by the tabletop medium makes it impossible to sustain.  Even in games like CofC  a player might start off roleplaying a frightened character but this falls by the wayside after a few sessions.

375,I am a Springboard grad and I know many people from there.  Here are my few cents: If you don't know what to do for becoming a data scientist and don't want to spend time to explore  go for it.  In terms of theoretical knowledge  a stats M.A doesn't learn anything new. Springboard uses Data camp and free YouTube videos for education (which is not a problem for me). Springboard's carrier coaching is good. However  does it worth 10k? There is a question mark here.   I was thinking that with the help of Springboard  I can find a job 4-5 months earlier than without such a help. In 4-5  months  as a data scientist  I can make around 20-25k. So  expense of the bootcamp is already covered.  If you can get help for carrier coaching (from a friend or from a professionals)  with your background you may not need such a bootcamp.  I am looking for job around 5 months  and I still can't even get interviews. My background is education. Springboard doesn't have an education program to fix a guy like me.
376,On track an AWD will send at least some power to the front wheels coming out of an apex. This forward motion takes away from the maximum lateral grip potential. This can and usually does lead to understeer. RWD cars will have no reduction in the front tire grip potential which allows for maximum lateral grip and better rotation without running wide.
377,"Dude...  I've been doing this for over 30 years (yeah  probably longer than a lot of the people on this sub have been alive)  and I still get that. You're an artist  you have ideas  you have shit you want to say... you don't know how other people are going to react to that. And yeah  running a game is an art  of a sort. Don't let anyone tell you different.  So  you'll get jitters. You don't know how other people will react to that vision that you have. Because you've seen all of this in your head already  and you're just hoping that the people at your table will see it the way you see it.  Maya Angelou said (and I've found this to be painfully true  for better or worse) ""when people tell you who they are  believe them"". I would extend that to say ""when people give you credit for a game well done  believe them."" Accept that the people at your table liked what you provided them  particularly when they say that they did. Thank them  be bashful  do whatever you feel is right  but believe them. You created something and you gave it to them. They're thankful for that.  Don't stop getting better (there are always ways to get better)  but don't shrug off the compliments. You did good. Keep doing that."
378,"You can't. It's a feedback loop.  You need to conduct experiments ie. give credit out at random but even then the fact that the credit scoring system exists might change the behavior of people.  A simple example would be predicting watch time on youtube. Since the algorithm will suggest videos it think will be popular  the fact that the algorithm suggests them makes them popular so you end up with ""GLOWING RED HOT KNIFE"" videos in everyone's suggestions because the algorithm went too far.  These type of models are usually statistical and very simple in nature because a) regulations and b) you don't want to change your model while it's running. Basic shit like ""does the person have the ability to repay""  ""does this person have assets""  ""does this person have a history of paying on time"" type of things. They're intuitive and are based on research.  Before using ML or any other ""black box"" thing you need to stop and think ""what if goes tits up"". A bank will go bankrupt if an ML model goes tits up. A recommendation algorithm... nobody will probably notice if it goes tits up.  Using ML in environments where reliability is key is a fresh branch of research and a lot of the information is hush hush trade secrets."
379,What sort of experience do you bring to the table?  The second one is going to have fewer engineering challenges and art challenges.  Neither of these are good for first time developers  but if you have significant experience  either is achievable...although I feel like you wouldn't be asking this question if you had significant experience.
380,my old Honda I've been taking it to pep boys for the last year. I was visiting family and took their old RAV-4 to Firestone. my mom had been taking it to a local indie mechanic. he changed her oil and never rotated her tires for years.. never even mentioned it. she'll be going to Firestone from now on.
381,I want to learn how to code BFS  DFS algorithm for maze. But first I have to learn those algorithms properly. What is the best book to learn these algorithms?  I would love to read good books  but I can still read bad books and understand as I am pretty smart in learning(But SLOW  very SLOW).
382,A confirmed buyer has provided this invoice which clearly shows the Starlit Partner order drop shipped from MSI themselves.  The eBay listing #143753901768 ties up with my other evidence.

383,Like S.T.A.L.K.E.R? As in maybe a few of the mechanics and maybe a small area and none of the story  graphics and quality? Sure  there's a small chance. Making a game with the same scope as S.T.A.L.K.E.R though? No. Not with that few people in that short amount of time. There's a reason why it takes a few hundred developers several years to make a AAA game.
384,"I'll share a lil story that may offer some inspiration:  When I was playing Descent into Avernus in 5e  our party were defeated  the DM had the mini-boss we lost to present us with a choice. We would be released  if we agreed to do a task for him  but to ensure our loyalty he would take one character's soul as collateral. He or she would get it back once the task was complete. The task was not a good one  and mutually exclusive with our party's goals in Avernus. Our party were kind of a mottley crew and 2/5 players had already sold their souls for various reasons. That left the three characters who would never wish to sell their souls to a devil.  The impossible question had us stalled in circular arguments for a good ten minutes  before my character  the honour-driven Firbolg barbarian  quietly recited a line from the Code of the Firbolg - ""Give a thousand for nothing"" - and then declared he would give his soul. It was a fate worse than death for him  but he chose it willingly to spare his companions. It was a very ""I will take the ring to Mordor"" moment and provided a great deal of fantastic character interaction for the rest of the Campaign."
385,If I can grab some more single thread perf  I might just sell my 3700X and run whatever is best perf / reasonnable price in single thread.   I don't need a new mobo because I run a x570.    I'm kinda OK with all that. Will probably wait for a killer deal in the next month / year and do it.    No idea why you're all salty in here lol.
386,I really hope the 3000 series goes all the way down to the <$200 price point. If they make a 3040 Ti to be the spiritual success to the 1050 Ti  with RTX+DLSS support and no aux power connector for the $120-150 market  they'll sell eighty bajillion of them and they'll be in the steam survey top ten for a decade.
387,I live near Norfolk Naval Base in VA  so most car meets are (stereotypically) lots of Chargers  Challengers  and Mustangs. Other than that  there's a few porsches  lots of JDM  a dude with an Aventador sometimes comes out  and then there's me and a dozen other miatas!
388,"**Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul (Movie)**  Gave the series a quick rewatch to remember stuff. I think the MiA anime has more than proved its quality to me and was much more than a seasonal fad. Overall great production  engaging world and plot  the cons are indeed still Riko being dumb and naive from time to time  but man does it serves for some thrill. And more of this happens in the movie really.  Getting to the meat  Bondrewd. Easily one of the best executions of an antagonist I have seen. I remember people getting mad over him getting a nomination to best villain with his 10 minutes of screentime but...man  those 10 minutes are so terrifying. He did better in those minutes than so many villains I can think of. Bondrewd's actions are undoubtedly evil and immoral but when you see him you don't feel the real sensation of someone evil  just someone so incredibly out of touch with reality he doesn't believe he is doing bad. He at no moment of the movie is mad or angry and the MCs  he constantly applauded them and root for their success. Fighting him could be said that was an entirely voluntary choice of the protagonist  not because he was purposely being an obstacle.  Its so twisted how when you hear him define love and family its like  its makes sense. But he just has his very twisted way of showing it [MiA movie spoils](/s ""During the fight with Reg  Bondrewd would name the kid that his cartridge was made off. But this wasn't a taunt of the type 'look at how bad I am'  he was mourning them. Helping him obtain the Blessing was for him the biggest show of love they could do for him  and he loved them enough to remember those details. Bondrewd was so dedicated to his research he sacrificed his own body for it  that's why he doesn't think of this as something bad  he just expressed his love that way. Fuck  he is so distorted that when Reg tries to call him out for killing someone he replies 'Aren't you the one trying to kill me?'"")  When [MiA spoilers](/s ""the Prushka flashback happened  I immediately went 'Ah  here comes the flashback to make us cry'  but besides it being heartwarming  the thing is that it is her relationship with Bondrewd that we see  this monster that could barely be called human. For one moment  I almost felt warmed not only to Prushka  but to Bondrewd as well. Like I said  he indeed loved her."")  The movie also continues to pull off the grotesque and horrid scenes that made me yell out of pain without feeling necessarily edgy or ""this is **dark**!""  it is a very legitimate feeling and it is just disturbing to see those scenes.   Other things don't fall short. Animation was great too. The Abyss continues to be a very intriguing and absorbing setting that keeps you wanting for more. Its characters  well the same  Riko is a good PoV to see the unknowns of the Abyss but still is often too klutz and dumb. Reg is Reg  but I do look forward to how the mystery about him develops. Nanachi however had more key moments and developm"
389,"I did manage to run this year a campaign I´ve designed when I was a teenager but never really had a good group to run it.  The story is about a group of heroes that find a child being transported in some sort of cage and as the game develops they learn that she is the godess of the moon   which has been striped from her memory and powers.  The trick is that she also has no ideia of extent of her powers  so she has to learn what it is to be mortal and what it is to be a god  and as the campaign develops the actions the group take towards her impact how she is going to be when she ascends to godhood.  What happended during the campaing that made it very unique was that the players started as a bunch of no good guys with eveil intentions and by their contact with the child they became better people as the mage taught about  ethics  the bard woman talked about sisterhood  the fighter teached about self defense and so on.  And one thing I´ve added to get the campaign going is that everytime she learned about her past she would ""grow up"" so from toddler to tenager  then to young adult  mature and finally an elderly woman. The idea there was to represent the moon phases and all  being that I used the blood moon as a ""final phase"" were she would lost her mind due her lovers death and the players had to roleplay their way to make her not ascend as an evil god"
390,I agree with the advice to give the players a chance to expose the conspiracy. Something to keep in mind is that a perfect conspiracy that makes no mistakes and leaves no evidence is boring  because they'll win without the PCs ever having a chance to do anything about it. The Watergate scandal is a quintessential example of how small mistakes can lead to exposing a much bigger conspiracy.
391,"The Google Cloud team has put together an excellent specialization for this purpose called: ""Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform""  If you're just interested in the productionization part  then ""End-to-end Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform"" is probably sufficient for you. Note that all these courses are free to audit on coursera."
392,"A university digital circuits course will almost certainly include a component on some sort of an HDL. We used verilog. Companies typically have their own libraries and even whole ""programming"" environments based on some HDL.   HDL's allow you to abstract away all electronics  and you're left with only the logic part  which then is very close to actual programming in terms of appearance  but you're actually describing the hardware."
393,I liked their top 10 lists when they did those but overall the site just started declining in good articles and content. The final straw was when they dragged politics into their homepage. Got unbookmarked a while back and haven’t missed them
394,I like it too. You get high quality education in a topic withh cheap price. I use edx sometimes but I prefer coursera. Udacity is very good and expensive  Udemy is cheaper but lower in quality but you will find good courses. I used Futurelearn years ago they are good  but they focus on readings and articles more than videos  not sure if they have data science lectures.
395,blender is a completely free 3d software and probably your best bet. As for 2d there arr pixel and vector based programs (photoshop uses pixels and illustrator uses vectors) which one you need depends on what you want to do. I recommend gimp and inkscape as free alternatives to adobe products.
396,Im a data analyst with a Bachelors in statistics and math has never come easy to me!! The most useful subjects imo were Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. I struggled hard with both of them  but even without mastery the experience was invaluable!
397,"There are two buttons just to the left of the steering wheel below the gauge cluster. There is a title saying 4ws and there a button saying ""sport or normal"" and another button saying ""revs 2ws"" just wondering what these two buttons do as a couldn't really find any info on the gtr cheers"
398,"My degree/hope for job prospects basically means I have to be somewhat sociable. So I guess that we are all socially awkward. I am a pretty introverted person but if I have to initiate/carry a conversation I can. I don't find it hard to work with others it can actually be enjoyable I just need a break from it after awhile.   Never was a ""weird kid"" who only got into anime because I felt socially ostracized. It actually was the opposite initially only reading manga and later watching anime was due to friends pushing me into it since they all liked it. I didn't want to be left out. Eventually I started to enjoy it more as I sought out more animated shows and films.  The other one I guess is how people assume that those within anime are so obssed with it they have no other life experiences or hobbies. I got plenty of other hobbies and history by far beats out any other hobby I have.   I guess within the community way too many people overestimate that a series being aimed at an older audience inherently will make it better written. Some of the YA stuff (shonen/shojo) is written better than the supposed mature stuff (Seinen/Josei)."
399,So: if you take a game built to use 4GB of VRAM and put it on a card that is identical but has 8GB of VRAM  you're unlikely to see any kind of interesting performance uplift  right?  Can someone in the know answer whether PCIe bandwidth is in a similar boat? That is to say: if all the game testing and dev happen with a PCIe 3 card  wouldn't that make it unsurprising that the game isn't any faster with PCIe 4? And if it is similar  is moving to double the bandwidth as default something that is useful for game dev in the future?
400,I have several kinds of SSDs running in several of my computers throughout my house and saw an LTT video regarding that having a DRAM on your SSD is more beneficial versus those without and was wondering how you can tell which SSDs have DRAM versus those that don't?  Below are the SSDs I have and are currently being used:  * Crucial CT960M500SSD1 * Crucial CT120BX500SSD1Z * Samsung SSD 850 EVO 120GB * Kingston SA400S37/120G * ADATA SP600 64GB * Western Digital WDS500G2B0A  I should state I notice in my main system (it's the first one on the list the M500) gets extremely sluggish when I do extremely intense tasks and I am worried this may not have a DRAM cache possibly  but I can't seem to find any documentation regarding it. Should I bother trying to upgrade it if that's the case? CrystalDiskInfo reports having 85% left in terms of health status.
401,Basically none.  There are plenty of data scientists that had 0 mathematical training beyond what they'd have in highschool.  Data science isn't as hard and fancy as people make it out to be. If you can get the job done in Excel and get that big fat bonus and impress stakeholders... who cares if you didn't use machine learning or fancy statistical techniques?
402,In my experience  the worst damage you can do to a manual car when learning is burning the clutch and stalling  maybe hard shifts if you're really messing up. So just get those principles down and the car will be fine. Vehicles are made to last a long time (mostly)  they won't just break if you're learning on them. Else  how else did other people learn  you know?
403,Savage Rifts with the freedom squadron planning and operations card game.  This combination works extremely well for base building and arbitrarily passing time.  Edit: With the caviat that the gm tells the story  not the players.
404,I once had a 2001 Mercury Sable. The guy I sold it to told me him and his wife are Sable enthusiasts. I really want to go to a meet of Sable enthusiasts since that day.  Also a dude in my home town who had three Yugos. I assume the other two were to keep one running. I always wanted to talk to that guy and get some perspective on the Yugo. I saw Doug's video about it  but it would be better to talk to an owner I think.  Also was supposed to attend a donk meet this year  but that got cancelled. As ridiculous as they are  I love donks. It looked like it was gonna be an awesome time because they had live music and free BBQ.
405,The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter (俺だけ入れる隠しダンジョン 〜こっそり鍛えて世界最強〜  Ore Dake Haireru Kakushi Danjon ~Kossori Kitaete Sekai Saikyō~) is a Japanese fantasy light novel series written by Meguru Seto and illustrated by Note Takehana. It began serialization online in January 2017 on the user-generated novel publishing website Shōsetsuka ni Narō. It was later acquired by Kodansha  who have published five volumes since August 2017 under their Kodansha Lanove Books imprint. A manga adaptation with art by Tomoyuki Hino has been serialized via Kodansha's Niconico-based Suiyōbi no Sirius manga service since 2018. It has been collected in four tankōbon volumes. Both the light novel and manga have been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment.[3] An anime television series adaptation by Okuruto Noboru will premiere in January 2021.  Here is the [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hidden_Dungeon_Only_I_Can_Enter) of information.
406,"this reminds me of the show ""How I met your mother"" where Ted pronounces Chameleon as ""Cham-el-lee-on"" instead of ""Kah-meal-ion"" because he had only ever read the word.    I have heard die-20  D-20  twenty sider  just ""20"" and for other dice I've heard similar. percentage dice  percentage die  D-100  on and on.  It doesn't bother me  but I do like D-20 the best myself  feels more relaxed."
407,I have similar results.  In comparison - 4 weeks ago I was also in PAX Online  which had exactly the same format as Steam Festival - but I didn't have a demo yet. I got 15% of the wishlists than from Steam Festival with an actual demo.
408,For the most part  just leave it in normal mode. Sport mode just makes it so that the rear wheels turn the same as the front wheels all the time. In normal mode  the rear wheels turn opposite of the front below 25km/h.  Sport mode doesn't tighten up the suspension- it has the same front and rear suspension as all FWD ST18* models without TEMS. It also doesn't tighten up the steering.
409,The reason they’re doing this is because they want to have the game completely finished a few weeks before November 18th so they can manufacture all the hard copies of the game and get discs in the hands of the people that pre-ordered on day 1.   This is why digital downloads are the way of the future. if they don’t finish during this crunch I don’t think they’ll delay the game again  it just means the people who pre-ordered physical copies won’t get them day 1 like all the digital copy people
410,Okla has a tendency to lie. Idk if its their fault but it happens. It defaults to connecting to the server that is hosts by your internet provider. Eg. I had VIP internet connection and when connected to VIP server it showed like 45-60mbs and lile 10 on all others
411,tl dr: four cards were tested:  \- FE RTX 3080  \- ASUS TUF OC RTX 3080  \-  Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 3080  \-  Zotac Trinity (non-OC) RTX 3080  All four were stable at stock  all four experienced crashing when oc to over 2ghz  Zotac Trinity experienced more instability than the others at this frequency.
412,It hard to say exactly when they will be needed  the direct storage API will be coming to PC in 2021 so that’s the absolute shortest timeline. As for when direct storage will be used that’s harder to say.   But the earliest you can safely buy an SSD without any worry is the moment Sony provides their PS5 compatible whitelist  if an SSD is in the list theres basically no doubt it will get the job done for the lifespan of the console generation.
413,>The logic is that AWD specifically refers to the cars ability to intelligently send power to wheels that need it  That is traction control/terrain mode  and the drivetrain just happens to be able to drive all four wheels. I don't think any definition of AWD requires intelligence in where it sends wheels  unless mechanical differential control (limited slip) are defined as intelligent.
414,Hi  I'm finishing up the course. If you're a statistics MS there is zero need for you to do this course. You should have no issue getting a job without the course! I don't regret going through the course  as I did land a job (halfway through the course)  but for your money  you aren't getting any leg up on anyone  especially since you will be graduating with a Masters degree.    I would recommend saving your money now and just finish up your MS. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about the course or curriculum!
415,I threw a krakolich at my high-level D&D 3.5 players once. A highly intelligent  undead kraken that had turned itself into a lich. As a powerful spellcaster had access to some powerful magic  meaning it chased them out of its deep-sea chasm lair  into the shallows and then took to the air to chase them overland. They managed to slay it eventually  but their faces when they realised getting out of the water wouldn't save them was highly entertaining.
416,It's also double the price for the top edition for way less than double the content!  Honestly I'm fine with low-detail airports  and since I'm playing it through Xbox Game Pass on PC it hasn't cost me nearly as much as folks buying it on Steam.
417,If I'm not mistaken  Nana was able to dig that trap just in time before the time traveller went back to the same spot? I thought the travelling back and returning to the present are kinda instantaneous.
418,I spent $3k on a computer last Black Friday  to learn data science and get deeper into computer vision. I took out a credit card with 18 months 0% apr. I've slowly been paying off the past year. I really just import scikit learn and use pytorch. I've barely scratched the surface where I'd ever need a $3 000 rig for data science.  Also windows subsystem for Linux used with the new windows terminal gives you the best of being able to use Microsoft and photoshop applications along with using almost all Linux commands. I had a dual boot linux windows because I needed microsoft for work. I find the WSL with windows terminal I barely even touch my dual partition.   In the end  I've used it way more to play games than I've used it for data science. Was it worth it?   Absolutely.  I use my computer every day for almost  10 hours a day. With covid and working from home having my overpowered tank makes my life so much easier. Gaming is more fun on my desktop than on my ps4. And when I do finally get around to training YOLO on a custom data set my laptop doesn't sound like an airplane taking off.
419,My favorite SQL method of study is finding a dataset  loading it in  and learning how to query what you want to know. I'm a learn-by-doing person though  and none of the SQL practice queries and questions I've come across really mirror the actual SQL I use day to day.  If you're working on window functions  you can practice by using a window function to aggregate instead of a group by.   IE  ``` SELECT ID  COUNT(Purchase) FROM SalesSheet GROUP BY ID ```  Becomes  ``` SELECT ID  (row_number() over (order by purchase desc)) as PurchaseCount FROM SalesSheet ```
420,As a Linux user  [EME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted_Media_Extensions) for HTML5 has been a real mixed bag in the final summation.  The good news is that nobody has an excuse for using Flash or Silverlight for their ([dubious](https://melpon.github.io/rfc/rtmpe.html)) DRM any more. But realistically  without EME would they have been using Flash or Silverlight today?  The bad news is that nobody should be under the impression that arbitrary combinations of OS and architecture are supported by binary DRM plug-ins like Widevine. And anyone who thought there'd be less DRM on streaming video was wrong as well.  I surely was disappointed with Prime Video back when it used an obsolescent Flash that required deprecated [HAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_\(software\)) on Linux. But I would have expected better with HTML5 EME than [we see today](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/hbo-max-cranks-up-the-widevine-drm-leaves-linux-users-in-the-cold/).
421,Hi everyone   I’m looking for apple Magic Trackpad for windows?   At my office we had macs with the Magic Trackpad but we’ve switched to thinkpad x1 extremes and I miss it dearly!   I used to be able to make precise mouse movements but now I can’t.   Would be really appreciative of suggestions!
422,My buddies and I rented a cabin for my birthday a few years ago  and I ran them through the first book of Rise of the Runelords in a weekend. I believe we played for something like 13 hours the first day and 11 the second.
423,I have a few questions. 1)How wide is the field of data science? Suppose I've learnt machine learning and everything ( I don't know what else I'm just a beginner)  then how many options do you have? Is one of them better than the other?  2) Is preparing for algorithms necessary to get a data science job? Because everywhere else  it's compulsory ( kind of)  3) Apart from forums  where can you get someone to mentor you  guide you through this  because data science in the beginning is like a dark cave and just Googling is a very dim candle  so to say?     Thank you for reading and answering. 😊
424,Whilst this is hilarious  I'm fairly sure that having the game stored on vram is actually going to be a net loss performance wise  not only does it occupy vram (which tbf isn't a constraining factor in this particular instance)  but it also means that any reads/writes to the virtual-disk are going to be competing with the gpu itself for PCI-Express (potentially a big impact) and memory bandwidth (less so  but contention might become an issue?) on the card.  I'd need to see some numbers to be sure but it wouldn't surprise me to see this induce a spot of microstutter.  I'm gonna have a dig around and see if anyone has run AS-SSD using a vram-disk like this  because those numbers could be real interesting.
425,Hey guys  I'm a first time poster on this sub reddit and I'm kind of looking for a data analyst to talk to about this. I started my college journey in a pseudo programming major of Information Systems. I realized that it was preparing me more so for an IT job so I changed my major to Data Analytics and Computing and even though I have a basic understanding of Python  I feel like I don't understand anything and I'm terrified that I won't be qualified to get my first job out of college and that I won't be able to support myself due to not knowing what I'm doing. I'm a generally quick learning dude and I'm not technologically challenged at all but I can't get over the fear that I don't know what I'm doing.  Should I be worried for the future?  Are there steps I should be taking to do better or learn more?  I want to get better before it's too late.  TL DR - I'm a senior in college majoring in DA and I don't feel like I know anything enough to go into the work force and I'm terrified for the future.
426,Hi  i wanted to make this post to see how other people plan out projects they make. like for example how do you plan out the systems you code on paper before you actually code it  how do you come up with stories / quests / missions? how would you architect everything so it makes sense? just to make it clear  i’m not asking any specific examples of how a specific game was planned but how would you guys generally go about doing that?
427,Cars in general are moving in the wrong direction for driver enjoyment honestly  but a great direction for daily driving. Can't find a stick  everything super heavy  but they ride really well  power is up even on cheap cars  even economy cars are getting better appointed interiors and features like adaptive cruise. There's almost nothing left that can be called enjoyable from a driver's perspective that also is brand new and also is practical enough to daily (this is what BMW used to own btw)   I'm honestly about to give up on finding / owning one car to fit both bills and just get a smooth cruising crossover or wagon to daily and an old roadster (maybe a Z4 or Boxster) or miata to have fun with.
428,If you're wanting an excuse to build a gaming PC that's also more than capable of doing deep learning  then sure. However  it's far from necessary. You really only need something that is CUDA-enabled period. I think a lot of folks new to ML go out and buy a really expensive rig out of exuberance and then fail to use it enough on training to justify the expense.  I use a laptop with an MX series GPU  and I'll offload anything to the cloud that actually needs to run for any lengthy period of time.
429,Lancer is an excellent and very elegant system—super easy to pick up quickly. It’s mainly focused on mech combat  but the far-future setting is also fun and leaves a lotta room to play whatever kind of game you want
430,All the time in my lowered G35. I'd cringe any time I had to go over something in the road  usually roadkill or the like  and I felt like my spine was gonna be ejected out my ass any time I drove into the city due to how bad our roads are.  I actually just bought a truck to daily for this reason  and the fact that my car won't see salt and thus rust anymore.
431,Hades is a fast paced rogue-lite where when you get a game over  you start over from the beginning. The game is designed extremely well for replayability with plenty of interesting characters  abilities  equipment  and even decorating to mess around with.  1.0 wraps up it's nearly 2 year early access on Epic and Steam. It adds a little bit new of everything and gives the story it's final arc.  [Here's the Hades 1.0 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZZFlcE0fWE).
432,It appears that all of them are quite so-so no matter how much you're paying for the card - you're getting pretty much a similar quality PCB. You're really paying for somewhat different amounts of metal on the heatsink and artificial segmentation based on power limits. Otherwise it looks like the most expensive MSI isn't much different than the cheapest Zotac. Triple 8pins are pointless on all of the reviewed cards so far.
433,Gaming performance improvements are impressive  however  I am not interested in average FPS when it comes to CPU performance. It's minimum framerate that is most important to me so I'll be waiting for some independent reviews before I spend any money.
434,Hi  I'm going for a career change to data science. I thought about going to graduate school and get the Master's degree  but the tuition is too expensive for me and my gpa from university is a bit low  so I've decided to take the certificate program at UCI at the end of this month. Do you think this would be a worthy choice  or would you still recommend going for the Master's degree instead?
435,Depends how you frame it on a resume. If your goal is to become say a CMO of marketing this moves you closer to that goal. If your goal is to become a lead data scientist  or CIO  this probably moves you further from that.
436,"Hello.  I have interests in physics  optics  programming  geometry/maths  and gaming. I would much like to work on the advancement ray tracing. I have a generic science associate's right now and wonder if it'd be a good bet to continue school for this.  * I like the idea of engine development as well. Would this fit well with developement of raytracing? * If I were to continue school for this  would I just have a computer graphics focus  take other classes like physics and optics  and/or something else? * Is a degree worth seeking to become a ""raytrace developer"" or should I learn on my own? Where would I start? How would I land a job?"
437,"Maybe try getting a copy of ""Weapons of Math Destruction"" from Cathy O'Neil ([https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/))  it might provide some valuable insight as to how not to design an unfair credit score model (there is an entire chapter dedicated to this subject)."
438,It depends if I can pay it off early at no penalty. If I'm anticipating a pay raise or cash coming in later like stock vesting etc  then it makes sense to essentially push back whem you put an extra chunk(s) of money down. If you can pay early  then you could just accelerate the payment to what it would've been under shorter terms.

440,"I use a fairy tale or ""legend"" approach. Consider all of the stories of the ancients or even the fairy tales in general. The stories always deal with things in a top down way. That's how I approach that world building. For instance  lets use a random example:  &#x200B   The world of <Insert name here  lets go with Aurora> Aurora. I think the first question isn't what is Aurora like  but rather  where did Aurora come from? Does it exist as a matter of fact and its people don't ask these sorts of questions because whatever the answer  for them  it doesn't matter  Aurora exists. Or is Aurora a dream  perhaps dreamed by a young noble woman who was cursed at birth and later in life fell into an eternal slumber? Is it the creation of tumultuous and unfettered gods and goddesses or just one god or goddess  or did it occur in a sudden snap of energy like the big bang?  Once we know where it came from  the next question is to ask  I think  is why. Why are we even bothering to explore Aurora? Is there some overarching evil (that must have an origin and a goal as well)   is it a desire to see local wrongs righted or to help a king or queen gain the throne or thwart the machinations of an evil dragon-sorceress whose defeat might also inevitably end Aurora as we know it so we must find the only sufficient defeater of some malefactor  perhaps not in a cold iron battle axe  but in true love's kiss?  So that's what I usually do. From there it becomes easier and easier. I lean heavily not simply on the ordinary history but the extraordinary historys as well. Consider the exchange beween Eomer and Aragorn in Rohan at their first meeting:     >“Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'   A  man may do both ' said Aragorn. 'For not we but those who come after  will make the legends of our time. The green earth  say you? That is a  mighty matter of legend  though you tread it under the light of day!”"
441,Lucky I'm just waiting for the black ps5 to come out first...
442,I’m not sure what everyone else is thinking yet but I was pretty underwhelmed.  Price increases  comparing against the previous “X” line instead of “XT” despite the price increase  comparing an $800 16 core against a $500 Intel 10 core  with many of the tests being a tiny increase. I also doubt they come with cooling considering the XT line didn’t. I can’t believe they actually showed a benchmark of the new CPU doing 3% worse than the previous one in Battlefield. I guess honestly is nice.  They’ll sell regardless of the price increase because people love AMD and they’re fine chips  but I hope they get some pushback.
443,Excellent post  thank you. I’m currently a DS  3 years exp  at a well known company  but I get to do very little actual DS work since I own the revenue data. Like you said  it ends up being more SQL reporting. Do you have any suggestions on DS projects tied to revenue  like what sort of models you’ve found useful in that space? Thanks again for the insights!
444,Hi guys  wish to get your opinion on this. What do you think is the right way to accurately determine performance of a marketing campaign?  Assuming that we just ran a campaign for our product (which can be bought online or offline).  Usually the approach is to look at the increase in sales during campaign activation (so comparing 2 weeks before  2 weeks during and 2 weeks after to see the difference and trend in sales.  Is there a more mathematical / data based approach to this?  I recently came across this video which talks about determining whether the variances of 2 populations are equal and then using a T test to test for statistically significant differences between pre and post campaign sales.  What do you guys think? Is it suitable or overkill?  Thanks!
445,You can get gold vinyl wrap to put on the emblems. The only other options for those would be to replace them or somehow have them re-plated.  Get some leather/vinyl conditioner to put on the vinyl top. This should help keep it soft and somewhat pliable. Try to avoid letting anything hit the top when it gets below zero. It should be fine though.
446,Hey there   I'm in a need of car jack for my car. I'm curious about the weight  obviously  sellers show a rated weight limit for the jack. For example 1.2 t.  My car's kerb weight (the one without passengers and cargo) is 1160 kg. So a 1200 kg limit jack would be ok if I want to change a flat tire? Lifting one corner of the car is not the same as lifting the whole car  right?  Any insights would be really helpful  thanks!
447,Why is this even a topic? Curious if any of you other gamers honestly care about this ongoing FPS stat we’ve been seeing waved in front of our eyes this past year.   I for one find this of little importance. There is SO much more I’d value in a game  but I figure someone has to think so highly of it.
448,"A game dev negotiating a ""max limit set"" for things like time  size of game  etcetera"" would be good. Just a general pre-negotiation system that could be enforced and recorded by the system would be good to prevent some of the crazy mishaps that would come to mind if it were just an off-the-record free-for-all kinda thing. Some guy dumping 100 dollars on a new dev who soon finds out they're in over their head could be kinda scary  so limit-setting with negotiation sounds like a good idea. Also an idea would be the dev being able to have an account with multiple income receivers if they're working as a team  or just team-account integration for devs in general would be good  maybe in a way where independent accounts can create a cohesive group but also disband or do stuff independently alongside team stuff. Hope this helps! Best of luck to you and your cool idea!"
449,Exactly! I read way too often around here people using data scientist and machine learning engineer interchangeably. There’s so much more than that. My background is in math so I write scripts that do statistical stuff. After a database guy sets up everything  after a ml person builds models  but before a tableau person makes it all look pretty.   If someone’s good at all of that then great! Everything seems to be getting more and more specialized though and that’s going to lead to more and more people focusing on specific things.
450,"A few months ago you might have heard about the revelations of sexual harassment and abuse going on at Ubisoft.  I didn't say anything then because (as a guy) I didn't want to make it about me.  But now I want to get something off my chest.  I worked at the Montreal studio as a programmer for about 5 years. Most of that was on R6 Seige  but like most Ubi employees I moved around a bit. I don't know exactly where to start or end this post  so I'm just going to leave some bullet-point observations:  * Ubisoft management is absolutely toxic to anyone who isn't in the right clique.  For the first 2 years or so  it was actually a pretty nice job.  But after that  everything changed.  One of my bosses started treating me differently from the rest of the team.  I still don't really know why.  Maybe I stepped into some office politics I shouldn't have?  No clue  but he'd single me out  shoot me down at any opportunity  or just ignore me at the best of times. * When it comes to chances promotion at Ubisoft  there's basically this hierarchy that goes something like `French (from France) > Quebecois > anglophone > everyone else`. * Lower levels of management will be forced to constantly move around because they're pawns in the political game upper management is always playing.  The only way to prepare yourself for this is to get the right people drunk. * When I was hired  they promised me free French classes.  This never happened.  I moved to Montreal from Vancouver with the expectation that I would at least be given help learning the language almost everyone else was using.  Had I known that from the beginning I would have paid for my own classes years ago. * When my daughter was born  they ratfucked me out of parental leave with a loophole (maybe I could have fought this but idk). I had to burn through my vacation for the year.  When I came back I was pressured into working extra hours to make up for the lack of progress.  It wasn't even during crunch time. * After years of giving 110% to the company  I burned out pretty bad and it was getting harder and harder to meet deadlines.  They fired me citing poor performance.  Because it was ""with cause"" I couldn't get EI.  Sorry for the sob story but I felt it was important to get this out there."
451,Animal Crossing works on real-world time/calendar  while like you said  Stardew Valley works on an in-game time.  If you want both  then best thing you can do is implement it  playtest it  and see if it works.
452,Call of Cthulhu kind of leans a lot on being able to go to the library/university/rare books store. There are modules that involve going into the back of beyond but that is often as an endgame  or deliberately to make a big chunk of what makes a CoC character effective of limited use.  I'd suggest checking out Fear Itself. It is the generic horror GUMSHOE version  and makes running and hiding a bit more of an effective strategy  even for people who aren't athletic or stealthy.
453,My guess is that the hat moves up and down while running because it has an offset that being applied from `sin()`. If you look up sine on Wikipedia or if you're using Unity use `Mathf.Sin(time) * Mathf.InvLerp(speed  minSpeedFotHat  maxSpeedForHat)` as a y offset.  Maybe they use sine waves for other variation too.
454,Hello reddit recently i've been making my own table top rpg system consist popular 90's fps games such as doom duke nukem and wolf 3d just need some suggestions of what i should add i alread have a armor system attack point/move system and skill system and im making a list of weapons for the the game.I just need some tips and advice what weapons shoud i add what systems i should include to make the experience enjoyable.Do You guys have any ideas?
455,For a funny and memorable name I love to use obnoxiously long French names  i.e. *Jean-Luis Baptiste de Saint-Exupery*  and then I play the character with the most outrageous French accent  akin to the French knights in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
456,There aren't many Data Science programs in Canada. I know of UBC  SFU  which is more cs background focused  Ryerson and I think Western University in Ontario. Note that Vancouver where UBC and SFU is an expensive place to live in.  Masters programs in Data Science in Canada:  1. UBC(2 campuses Vancouver and Kelowna)  [https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) 2. SFU( [https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/graduate-students/academic-programs/professional-master-of-science-in-computer-science/about-the-program/big-data.html](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/graduate-students/academic-programs/professional-master-of-science-in-computer-science/about-the-program/big-data.html) ) 3. Ryerson University( [https://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/programs/data-science-analytics/](https://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/programs/data-science-analytics/) ) 4. Western University( [https://www.uwo.ca/mda/](https://www.uwo.ca/mda/) ) 5. U Waterloo  [https://uwaterloo.ca/data-science/graduate-programs/programs](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-science/graduate-programs/programs)  6. A US program but i heard many good things about it. [https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics)  &#x200B   I would suggest to email each program and ask about GPA requirements. Some like Ryerson are fairly strict about it. Some may look at only the last 2 years.
457,you can search in youtube and see what tutorials are missing and do a tutorial that is not already there. i mean there are lots of FPS tutorial and people will likely watch the series that has a lot of views already.
458,Its kinda crazy some of you drive 10mph/15kmh more  my general rule is 10kmh plus and pretty much everyone drives like that in Europe/Hungary  there is a big difference in town especially between 50kmh (speed limit in towns/cities) and 65kmh.
459,The vast majority of gamers don't have a 2080 Ti. Only 0.96%  You simply can't assume that the screen resolutions used by the average steam user is the same as resolutions used by the average 2080 Ti user. For starters  1366x768 is a resolution only used by cheap laptops: No 2080 Ti user will be using that resolution.  We don't have numbers for what resolution the average 2080 Ti user had  but I think we can assume less than half of them are stuck on 1080p. Why spend $1200+ on a GPU then cripple it by pairing it with a cheap $300 monitor?  4k uptake around 2080 Ti users is probably much higher  maybe 20-30%
460,Honestly that's disappointing  anyone looking to get 'lightweight' rwd  'sports'  fun car is better off getting an mx5 - much lighter  handles even better  much cheaper  easier to turbo  more reliable... the only advantage BRZ/GT86 has is rear seats. But why would u want that in a sports car? Not much room in the back of the current gen anyway  and if u got a family get a family wagon. The only reason I was sort of looking forward to next gen BRZ/GT86 was rumoured factory turbocharged engine  now that seems to be nothing but a dream
461,If you don't want to learn a new system  Five Torches Deep is simplified 5e  There are also a ton of OSR games that offer rules-light systems.  If you want to stray further from DnD  Forbidden Lands is  an easy system to learn and to prep for. It comes with a setting  but you don't have to use it. In fact the DM resources can be used with any system.  Dungeon World is a great choice as well  if you want to move towards more narrative play  although it tends to favor more cooperative storytelling  and from what you're telling us it seems you enjoy creating your own narratives.
462,As the title states  I junked my car last night.  A guy came and picked it up.  It had a clean title.  I couldn't get the plate off myself  the bolts were too rusted.  He said he'd get it off without damaging the car and I could pick up the plate tomorrow.  He said he'd text me the moment he got back and got the plate off.  He texted me he got back  said he'd text me in a few minutes.  Nothing since then.  It's been 14 hours.  He hasn't answered texts or calls.  What should I do?  Is this something I can call the police over?  I need my plate.  I'm clueless as to what to do.  Edit:  For context  it's an out of state plate.
463,"Well  in a setting where death is not as permanent  getting killed may not be so bad a thing.  ""Yes  we did kill the original you  but we also value your skillset.  Here's a paycheck.  Go collect your original's head.""  There could also be legal reasons.  Some cyberpunk settings have ""forking"" laws where you can't legally have two copies of a person running simultaneously  so the corp has ""registered"" their version as the ""real"" one which then necessitates the PC's version be ""eliminated.""  This could also be an interesting way to have the NPC eventually become a reluctant ally. (Altered Carbon  for one  and Nova Praxis  though the latter is an homage to the former)"
464,Personally I don't give a shit. Like on almost all laptops the built-in DAC just sucks. I'd rather use a USB DAC/Amp. Another advantage for using USB is that I get to use a magnetic connection. Way handier when I need to swap my headphones between devices. But it is kinda stupid that they claim there's no space for it (bullshit). I bet if you opened up that laptop  that there's some nook or cranny that's empty space.
465,Like someone else said  typically I would use a wiring diagram to physically find each component and unplug it one at a time while monitoring the amp draw across the fuse until you find the one which isn't playing ball.   Considering the components you actually have on the circuit  I'd be running tests with a manufacturer specific scan tool to see if any of those components are unhappy about something.    Check out South Main Auto and Diagnosis Dan on YouTube for some excellent insight into electrical fault diagnosis.
466,I’m not a huge fan of the ZF 8  but you’re a fucking moron if you think the S58 is a terribly motor. I just drove one in the X4M and it’s in actuality an excellent motor worthy of the M division. I wish it rev’d a little higher  but that’s a small nitpick.
467,I've actually found that mechanics are doing very well during all of this. I'm sure there are some that are not but I'll be damned if everyone mechanic I take my cars to don't have lots that are filled.
468,Traveller is my favorite and really good at doing gritty sci-fi. If you have no armor and someone points an assault rifle at you  chances are you're rolling a new character. Speaking of rolling characters its lifepath system is very good.  Stars Without Number is closer to D&D in it's character scaling and  while it's character creation and other player-related sections are very limiting compared to Traveller  it has a wealth of GM tools that aren't going to be matched elsewhere.  While I prefer Traveller if your group likes 5e you'll probably be more comfortable with SWN. SWN also has a free version that barely cuts out any content so you can have a read through before deciding as well.
469,"It's not just the pandemic imho. Let's take for example JDM hot hatches/coupes that are relatively rare  sought after and which skyrocketed in price. Each year a % of these cars gets totaled in crashes  disassembled to sell for parts for profit or rust beyond sensible repair (one thing japanese didn't get right was rust proofing  zinc plating the body  etc.). Of course prices will never go down as years roll by  because less cars remain on the road and those who are in good condition and cared for are even less than the overall number which is already not exceptionally high to begin with. They are also starting to gain a classic status which will bump up the prices even more. And if you think US is bad  come over to Europe where even the most clapped out examples go for an absurd amount of money (IF you could find them). Now  I get that some people ""KnOw WHaT tHeY HavE""  but we should stop thinking of the prices like it's ten years ago  because that time is gone and if you were fortunate to buy then  well  good for you."
470,"No  not for regular desktop computer gaming. It's expensive to make the display hardware  it's expensive in terms of resources used  and it yields no discernible difference in quality unless you're playing on a gigantic screen. Even then  at a distance that will result in comfortable viewing angles  you won't be able to see a difference.  At some point  maybe 15 years from now  manufacturing an 8K display might be close enough in terms of cost to 4K screens that it will be worth it just for marketing.  And to all the people saying ""probably not this gen"" or ""it might be a few more years""  **i dare you** to remember my words and remind me if I'm wrong: There is a 0% chance that more than 1% of pc/console gamers will choose to game at 8K by the end of this decade."
471,"Unity is probably your best bet.  If you don't want to make the framework yourself there are existing (cheap) assets on the store that implement controllers etc for first person dungeon crawlers & visual novels. You'd just have to stitch everything together.  If you feel overwhelmed  pick one specific thing to do  do it  and then try and add it into the ""whole"" once you understand it.  As an example  when I made my first prototype in Unity  I first implemented a 2D player controller with basic movement and camera manipulation  then added interaction between the player sprite and objects  then added a dialog system etc."
472,Welcome back to Season 3 of GochiUsa  not just any Cute Girls Doing Cute Things Show  but probably THE quintessential CGDCT Show since 2013.  No other CGDCT show has ever gotten this many seasons with such great fanfare.  I hope you guys also remembered to watch the Dear My Sister 2017 movie and Sing For You 2019 OVA before starting Season 3. You won't miss much if you don't watch it  but can you call yourself a GochiUsa fan if you don't?
473,"Hey guys  I'm a PhD student in ""applied"" (which in my department means almost entirely abstract and proof based) mathematics  graduating in the spring. I don't plan on pursuing a career in academia anymore  and want to transition to data science.   I'm curious whether I should focus on learning skills on my own  and building a portfolio over the next year or so. The alternative is applying to my department's statistics master's program. The statistics master's takes 1 year  there are quite a few computational courses  and several professors in data science or related fields. The advantage there is I'll get a much deeper understanding of statistics  have a longer time to practice skills without a resume gap  and the opportunity to potentially have a publication worthy data science project."
474,Seems like Sony should’ve just sent preorder links to all active PlayStation IDs and had people order through the PS Store. I don’t work in product distribution  so I cant possibly account for all variables  but this seems like it would’ve been a more viable option for control than “hey  we’re gonna pick rando accounts to send links to”
475,I think you should do what you find fun with the world.There's a lot of opportunity for heroism - a Human colony under threat of invasion receives help from an alien race  a Space Marine Deathwatch group helps out a colony of Tau because the captain's home planet was attacked by the same antagonists - a band of orks interrupting a battle because 'we've never 'ad a three-way before!'  You can get away with a lot by changing the 'always' of the world to 'sometimes'Instead of every heretic needs to die  some of the people believe thatInstead of every alien needs to die  the characters care about ones that are trying to kill themInstead of there is only war  there can be a peaceful meadow on occasion to rest in
476,I desperately want to play in a teenage superhero game. It would be about teenagers who spontaneously discover they have powers in a world where superheroes don't already exist (so not like masks  or the X men). I'd want it to focus more on the teenage angsty teenage drama rather than super-powered action. The problem is that I don't think my friends would enjoy it and I especially can't see them GMing it :(
477,I'm wondering if the 25yr mark will have people trying to import some Euro Ms. Just an E36 would be nice  and of course an M Coupe would be amazing.  It's a depressingly long time off  but 125 & 135 hatches will be amazeballs.
478,If you are getting tuition from an employer start in the fall and skip summer trimester and you can get reimbursed for 4 different fiscal years.  Ie fall 2020  spring 2021  fall 2021  spring 2022  fall 2022  spring 2023.  If you start in the spring and do it all in a row then its only 2 fiscal years.

480,IBM Modeler was a neat idea to allow self-service statistical programming with a GUI. Turns out  replacing programming with a graphical GUI is a stupid idea and has never worked.  Things that are easy to express using text in a few lines of code become a fucking web of nightmares in spss modeler.
481,I was in the same boat. In a bit uni in UK and was trying to get and industry job in software engineering. It took me a few years. I think they believe you cannot meet deadlines. In the interviews stress that the projects you been working on had strict deadlines and you had to deliver based on the requirements of the projects. Moreover  you have to say that you worked with other people.
482,The terms vary widely  but in my mind this is a data scientist (or applied scientist if you want to be fancy) role. If you do half your work in notebooks  you're not an engineer.  In my mind  the main difference between MLEs and SWEs is which team they're on. This isn't true at every place though. Sometimes MLEs are on the engineering team. The exact dividing line between the data science team and the engineering team can vary a lot though. I've seen some organizations where MLEs help build molding training infrastructure and SWEs deploy models. But you also see the reverse.
483,"I think what some people struggle to understand about Excel is that you can rarely just replace it with one other tool. That is  in some organizations Excel functions as:  * Dashboard * App (to enter information) * Collaboration (multiple people entering information) * Data extraction (connect to DBs to get data on refresh) * Basic modeling * Ad hoc analysis (i.e.  new sources  new ways of looking at data  etc.) * Visualization * Presentation  When a Data Scientist says ""I want to replace Excel with Python""  what they usually mean is ""I want to replace Excel for the purposes of data extraction  modeling  MY ad hoc analysis  and visualization with Python"".   Some people want to go further and use Python for dashboarding and app building  but that's a smaller number.  An even smaller number have any plan for other users within the company to do their own ad hoc analysis.   And that means that Excel always survives because there are *other* people in the organization that need it. And as long as those people are using Excel  you're going to need to use Excel too."
484,2k up to 8k still looked great in control. So that's essentially an image where only 1/16th of the pixels are real  the rest are created by the algorithm. Pretty insane stuff. It's hard to wrap my mind around the idea that resolution is no longer going to be a limiting factor after 2 decades where resolution was the biggest limiting factor in gaming.
485,Haxe!  Use [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) for 2D games. If you’re a beginner  you shouldn’t start with 3D. Most of the concepts you learn in 2D will transfer to 3D  and it will be easier to transition once you have the experience.
486,Are there any 3080 cards that are considered safe to buy or does the whole crashing thing affect all of them? I haven't really kept up to date on this and not really sure where to start looking.  Igor's article mentions the 3080 TUF card as seemingly having recognised the issue and done something different  but can't really find anything about ASUS in particular. If it's just this specific card from ASUS or if  like  the Strix is also not affected?
487,A Few choices...  * ***Burning Wheel*** * ***Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay*** * ***Fate*** (Master's of Uumdar for Fantasy  but many other possibilities as is Multi Genre) * ***Ars Magica*** * ***13th Age*** * ***Shadows of the Demon Lord*** * ***Ironsworn*** (Solo) * ***Savage Worlds*** (Multiple Genres) * ***Gurps*** (Generic)
488,"Note to the naysayers. There is a decent market for retro/legacy equipment  just check eBay. I personally run an old Socket 7 with Windows 98 as a retro battlestation for old games I still like to play that won't run on modern OS's without hackey solutions. It also lets me use my old MS Sidewinder Force Feedback stick with all functions. Regarding drivers  pfffts  I had/have no problem at all finding drivers for retro parts.  In summary  ""worth"" is a relative term. There are still lots of people into the retro scene."
489,People are naive af if they think amd would show off their best performing card as an afterthought to the cpu presentation.    They are baiting nvidia  who has been very reactive to them (delaying 3070 launch date to right after rdna2 announcement  super series last year  higher vram variants planned end of this year) obviously amd doesn't want to tip nvidia off until the last possible moment on what to expect from them.
490,Chrysler Neon parked on the street parallel to mine. A few months ago. This was in the UK.  It was especially cool because it was a fairly standard model (not a performance example) that had been kept in very good condition but was also obviously still in regular use. For the less desirable variant of a somewhat rare car  that was nice to see.
491,The CPU clock speed is a small part of what makes a system work  and how well it works.  It would be fine if it had a few or more cores  was able to ramp up the clock speeds when the demand is there  was paired with 8GB RAM at least  and a nice size SSD.  There's so many factors.

493,Doesn't Mercedes use a similar idea but instead of a windshield its still on the infotainment screen?  I'd be really interested in seeing something like this merged with GM's PDR system so that it could display things like apexes and racing lines and other information on a track.   Maybe GM could map out tracks around the US and store that data on the PDR then once you do a lap you could use your lap data with the PDRs pre stored track data and have it displayed on your next run to see how you could improve showing and highlighting the information across your windshield.
494,I think that even if DLSS itself doesnt gain traction  another open standard or technique will because of it. For example  consoles are already hinting a some kind of resolution scale (XSX and XSX promo) probably by machine learning. MS developed an API for it and will probably push it hard to give its console an advantage against sony. This could carry over to PCs trough DX12U  since it should be a hardware agnostic solution. Also perf gains will become harder and harder to achieve while computational cost continues to rise along with higher resolutions  higher frame rates desired and now ray tracing  so this basically demands more efficient ways to render stuff  and upscaling  vrs and such things are some of the awnsers right now
495,I'm surprised that I haven't seen anyone bring up either Hybrid or Timecube.  Both of them are (if I'm remembering correctly) online only projects built by paranoid schizophrenics with penchants for RPGs in an attempt for them to wrestle with and understand the world around them.  Basically they were almost daily stream of conciousness discussions trying to explain real life  imagined events  and frequently movies and comic books MISTAKEN for real life  in terms of game mechanics  wonky formulas  die rolls  and lots and lots of charts. Also  as one might assume  both of them wade pretty deep into the waters of racism  conspiracy theories  and misogyny.   As an example  here's rule #371 from Hybrid:  >!RULE # 371: North Korea is consumed by Negative Energy in the form of paranoia (due to USA foreign policy & its soldiers) leading to self inflicted violence on its own nation referring to its own citizens of N.K.  but lot like some horror (Japanese) cartoon Manga film/movie  sort of like Bush I & Bush II projecting Negative Energy  hoping to collect Negative Energy from Iraqi oil & land. But  in a weird way  one can rationalize North Korea  but it would be scary to  for to understand North Korea is to understand humans  especially ability to be corrupted  which is similar to asking for a college education  since it’s not free  for employment which is form of bribe to receive employment as it’s a nice way of asking for a bribe  considering one can apply a 5 minute IQ test {using his or her COM  assuming his COM = his DP  {but note that when LS or Life Span is less than DP or Default Psyche  then PL or Power Level (either or both COM or/and INT or/and EGO  latter two which are normally measured @ C1 such as in HERO rpg but here it’s @ C2  where C2 = C1^LOG10(C1)) = C2 PL is greater than his DP  which in Aberrant rpg can be sometimes @ C2 or/and other times @ C1  and why those that play Aberrant sometimes give wrong total points to characters  due to wrong allocation of units}  where having a COM of 2 = IQ potential of/for 2 years of college  while a COM of 12 = IQ potential of/for 12 years of college  and having only a 1 COM = IQ potential of/for 1 year of college} & completely free using the RULE # 369 & there are couple of (2) others similar rules somewhere in my rpg < where one can get a college education [in theory] in just 5 minutes for free: annual salary in USA = [COM*(C3 PL of a country = 12 345 for USA)]  > rather than having to spend years & $10 000 to $100 000 or more on a college education  especially when students are doing the bulk of the work  while most of the lazy professors just copy notes from books for their lectures that anyone could do themselves anyway. There are many different forms of Negative Energy: the way US citizens treated the Native American Indians up until the end of the 19th century  pretty much the same as North Korea.!<
496,A long time  probably. Regardless of the PS5 SSD speeds  most games will still not utilize the full potentional of it for a few more years and most multiplatform games are going to be designed with PC hardware(including the more popular SATA SSDs) in mind.   I don't think Gen 4 NVMe will be needed for PC games for the next 2-3 years.

498,UCSD MAS grad in data science here.  There were few people who did not have much programming knowledge beforehand.  With that said  the first few courses taught basic programming in python and sql.  I agree with some of the other points to see if you even like programming first by means of bootcamp or online courses.  Before my masters  I learned python and ML on my own to apply to some areas at work.  Then I slowly got interested in it and ended up being a data scientist.
499,That's all totally normal man. D&D Is a creative outlet for us  especially for DMs. Everytime a session is about to start  it's not just us about robplay a game with friends. Its us  about to share something we created with a group of people. I'd imagine that anxiety you feel  and every other DM gets too  is akin to actors talking about butterflies in their stomach before stepping on to a stage.   Having experienced it myself and read a lot of other posts expressing the same experience  I'm begining to think the more time you prep  the worse this feeling is. Instead of knowing you invested time to make this great  you worry that if it fails  all that time was wasted and your players will wonder how that took you so long. Neither of those are true. If you enjoyed the time you spent prepping  and world building  and making NPCs  and figuring out the BBEGs next move  and making maps and riddles and clues and the list goes on forever.......then none of it was wasted. It's a part of your enjoyment of the game. Second the players have no idea how long you spent prepping  and they aren't going to judge you based on it  even more so if they have experience as a DM as well.   So dont worry man  you're not an impostor. You experience the same feelings every DM goes through before a session. And remember  by taking the time to consider whether your doing this well  or your players are enjoying it  you demonstrating that you're good at this  and you belong in that chair. Truly bad DMs never stop to consider if they are bad at this  they just barrel ahead confident they know everything.
500,To Me it's just overhyped.. I recently read the manga.. it's just slice of life with very very slow plot progression. Characters are really generic and bad.. but what makes it worst for me is it's animations  (less frames  color tone  line art). What you like about this anime?   This post is not a rant. I just want know why are people liking this.
501,Well  it absolutely runs counter to your second paragraph  but TROIKA! is a cute little RPG that blends sci-fi with fantasy (think spelljammer or some weird comedy fantasy novel). Maybe worth checking out for ideas at least? It's a bit more uber-high fantasy than post-apocalyptic or anything  but it's still the closest thing I can think of.  Everything about it is dirt simple. Character creation is completely random  hilarious and takes 5 seconds  and it has an innovative (and IMO great) token-based initiative system that emulates the chaos of battle nicely. While I don't necessarily think you'll like its mechanics based on your criteria  it's a good read  and might be cool for detail mining.
502,Crazy price  but the V spec II Nur is the ultimate spec (and final limited run series) of R34 GTR  especially in that iconic Millennium Jade colour (I had a diecast model exactly like this one). This is like the equivalent of finding an almost brand new Type-A Spirit-R RX7 or a almost brand new E46 CSL M3 in that iconic silver colour.
503,Lots of good answers already. Just want to add that pytorch is a python package (it literally has py in the name). New releases are in python  open source development is in python  other auxiliary packages in the ecosystem (e.g. pytorch-lightning) are in python  etc. Someone has put in a lot of work to port it to R  which is an amazing contribution to the R community  but fundamentally that's just a big workaround. If a company wants to use pytorch  they would just use it in python
504,Now let's see the 10th gen refreshed Accord please Honda. Hopefully AWD to compete with the Camry as well but I'm not getting my hopes up because even though the new TLX is nice I could see a lot of people opting for the Touring with AWD instead of it.
505,"Maybe there should be a sub for data fails LOL.   "" In the UK the number of cases rose rapidly.

507,It actually doesn't move at all since DDR  the first DDR  not 3.  At least if you compare the absolute best widely available for PC gamers who were decent overclockers.  DDR 400MHz cl 2.5 and even 2.0  DDR2 1100 4-4-4-12  &#x200B   We're stuck since around 2006.  That's why you still have Crysis 2007 PC game not being able to stay above 60fps no matter the GPU and resolution. That's why you still get 40fps in MS Flight Simulator 2020 no matter the GPU and res.  &#x200B   I wonder if we wanted to achieve a real 100% improvement  is there any technology available now  which would allow to do that? Remember  just because something doesn't exist  doesn't mean it can't. There need to be a decission there's a demand for it and there need to be a profit on the horizon. So that's why I'm asking. What if two companies invested $20B each into making the best low latency hardware  which would allow to double or tripple the 5GHz Intels  performance in every game and every scenario  offering 400fps where the best overclocked PCs offer 150-200fps now.  &#x200B   &#x200B   I remember Micon's HMC. That was supposed to improve the latency but it was about GPU. The GPU is not as dependant on latency as CPUs  so I don't know if this could be the way.  Sadly it was shut down by Micron  since the higher capacities and other things brought by HBM basically killed HMC. But I still wonder. Even if we'd get 4GB instead of 24GB per card. What would've been possible?  Maybe the on-board cache would've been a solution? But what type of cache? Where? What size? Unfortunately I don't know any game engine and CPU/GPU engineer  to ask those. But maybe someone here knows the answers or things which could point towards potential answers?
508,maybe this has been asked. I'm looking for a good system to run. theme doeskin matter  I'm going to tweak it for some Oceans regardless. Just looking for something some what easy  and fun game play.  thanks all!

510,I first saw *The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya* (2006) last December.  It had been a very long time since a show had shaken up my favorites  and I had become used to assuming I wouldn't find anything that really grabbed me.  *Haruhi* stole the #2 spot on my list  and it was a nice to be reminded that such could happen.
511,Including no CO2 taxes  EVs here in Norway benefit from free toll-passings a lot of places  no annual fees  free parking and free ferry rides.  There have however been discussion of dismantling these incentitives  as tax revenue is estimated to shrink with more EVs on the road.  Dennmark for example has nowhere near these numbers. You can take a guess why.
512,Everyone wants the BRZ to be turbocharged  everyone talked about how the STI should have 400 hp  but i've never seen a comment about Miata lacking power  Miata and BRZ are in the same price range but Miata has 20-50 hp less  Miata might be 100 kg lighter but the hp per ton is about the same with BRZ  I've never driven the 3 cars I mentioned above so this is purely just a discussion
513,One of the strengths of python is the quick development time it offers exactly because of these packages. That's why it is valuable to companies.  For my current project I wrote ~10000 lines of code combining 15 data tables from various sources to create a training set  train a neural net and create business relevant predictions. I'm very glad I don't have to implement my own data frame object or neural net training framework.
514,It would be nice to cover some of the drawbacks of putting a UI in HTML—for example  absolute and relative positioning is a bit of a mess  and it can be challenging to debug problems with your layout if you are using CSS.  Unity’s system may be a bit more primitive  but it is very well-suited for simple tasks like “put this button in the bottom-right corner of the window”  or “put this box in the center of the screen”. HTML+CSS are poorly adapted to problems like that.
515,So this is something that I've been wondering about and had a self-theory about it and how I got my games in the most efficient way to support developers. I was hoping a game dev with a published game on steam can explain the revenue situation in terms of refunds and what you receive back?   1. Buy a game for 10$ 2. Steam receives 3$ and Game developer receives 7$ (30% cut) 3. User refunds game and receives back 10$  In this scenario  I always assumed that the Game Developer loses 10$ (3$ in total in losses) because steam wouldn't want to lose their 3$. Is this correct? Or do you only lose the 7$ you got?   This theory that I couldn't find much about online has been in my mind for a few years ever since the steam refund policy changed and basically made me follow a new way to try games where I would basically get the game for *free from other sources*  and if I like it  I would buy it from Steam  No excuses. And if I don't then I just don't like it  and won't make the developer pay 30% of the game's cost for no reason.   Is my theory correct that devs are losing money on each refund?
516,Barbarian of Lemuria. It's simple and it can do anything with a bit of work and tweaking.   TinyD6 is also really great in that department.  Cortex is another great pick.  ICRPG is also a great contender.   Otherwise  Anything OSR has material to play forever if you can stomach it.
517,"What I don't like about D&D (any version honestly)  in the main  is that it never ""felt right"" for any game I ever wanted to run. * I don't like AC  it doesn't feel like it represents armor as I understand it. * I don't like hit points because it's never clear when a character is actually wounded yet they heal like ""wound points"". * I don't like classes because they're a catch-all for a group of abilities and special powers that define the character more than player choice. * I don't like the fantasy ""races"" it offers  they're either bog-standard Tolkienian or completely nutty trips into someone's psyche. * I don't like ""levels"" for progression  they feel completely artificial for that purpose and turn the game into a high-power fantasy.  All of these things set the tone for any game using D&D (and many other similar games). I don't like that tone. I've run 1e/2e and 3.x for many years  as well as other similar games  I just don't like it anymore. When I played 5e it was a snooze-fest.  Why I like Cepheus Light and Sword of Cepheus: * They're rules-light and easy to run skill systems. * Armor and damage generally act the way I expect them to  players don't pile up ridiculous amounts of hit points and every fight is potentially deadly. Wounds are actually wounds. * Characters start with an inherent history told through their lifepath. There are definitely downsides to the random generation but the results are fun to play. * Advancement is a slow burn and often more dependent on the equipment a character has accumulated. * The power level never gets out of control nor do players get fat heads from their abilities."
518,"50 to 10  ""emergency braking""? Punch the brakes and around 20-25 mph (not familiar with the ratios in your gearbox  but around the speed where the idle rpm in 5th is)  press the clutch too.

519,This is probably the real reason why SSD prices have been falling.  I could actually see them even undercutting the 2.5/3.5 spinning drives on price in the 1-4TB capacities. Seagate and WD will need to either significantly bump capacity per dollar for those bottom segment drives or seriously drop the prices to keep any business in those segments. Non-SMR 2.5 inch drives are stupidly expensive for what they are right now and there is no real justification for it.  If they are reliable I'd have no problem throwing cheap Chinese 1-4TB SSD's in a NAS.
520,I did a phone interview the other day and the interviewer was clearly CURRENTLY on my GitHub during the call looking at my project demos  testing them out  and asking me questions about the process.  I guarantee that one or two of my better projects are the only reason I got the interview at all since I have 0 work experience  just finished a boot camp a couple weeks ago  BUT I had finished  functional  projects to show them.
521,Genuine question: why drop $700-$800 USD on these already impossibly hard to find half-baked cards when you can get a next-gen console for as low as $400 (PS5 Digital) or the powerful Series X? ($500) - an entire multimedia and gaming hub?  A similarly spec'd PC as the XBOX would cost 2x-3x as much.....
522,I am currently learning statistics and data science online. Right now I  am learning the theory and formulas without a calculator  but some of  these formulas are seriously complex and time-consuming and I can't help but feel the urge to use my  TI-84 to compute some of the answers to save myself some headache. Of  course  I am making a point to learn the formulas first  but after I get  a good grasp on how to do the calculations by hand  I really want to learn how to do this  stuff on a calculator. Can you guys recommend some good online courses  (paid or otherwise) on how to use the TI-84 for statistics?
523,A hugely important aspect of data science  and one I am god awful at  is basically data engineering. Some professionals might be able to find some differences between the two  but they seem to be the same to me.  Anyways  this includes data storage  movement  and cleaning/collecting. This all really goes hand in hand with data analytics  and many people only think of this stuff as being the main aspect of DS  while the analysis is done by the analytics team.  The reason a data scientist has to be good at both though  is because when you start analyzing huge data sets  or running very complex algorithms on very large data sets  your RAM  internal storage  and what not become harder to use. You have to figure out how to batch things  etc  and doing so efficiently and dynamically requires an ability to change the code to permit a more dynamic storage of data  which in turn requires good data engineering.  Conversely  even the process of data engineering itself will ultimately lead to an analysis of things like compression  run time  etc  that can be done really well with a sort of meta data analytics.  I think being able to identify people you work with who are better at analytics would be best for you. Taking on some of their workload when it comes to the engineering of data that they struggle with would build your reputation outside of analysis  and allow you to maintain a good professional standing in data science.   You could in turn find someone good at analytics who could review your work before submission to give you some advice. This would be tough  as that could always just be seen as an added responsibility that would require extra pay  but it's always worth a shot.  You don't have to look outside the field  but maybe grow towards a skill set that is outside of your current position. Then eventually you may even find yourself with a new job title  and a more developed set of skills.  You could also always try to narrow the focus of your analyses  spend extra time outside of coding to brainstorm business relevant intuitions which lead to useful projects  and work much harder at building general  math relevant skills.

527,Not uncommon. People get games canceled on them all the time. Some people end up working on a string of canceled projects. This is one of the reasons why game developers want more relaxed NDAs—you might have done great work and still have no portfolio to share for it.

532,Yeah it’s normal if you’re downshifting into first. I’ve got 70k miles on mine and it’ll almost always shudder a bit. It’ll do it especially in sport mode when it’ll keep it in the lowest gear.   If you notice in most modes  the transmission will keep the car in 2nd gear until it comes to a complete stop so I think from the factory  1st gear is just always super jerky unless your accelerating. Too bad that’s the gear with the most crackles and pops.

534,Why would I  or anyone else working on a setting  go through the work of designing  testing  balance testing again  getting art  go through a rework  and then get told something simple was wrong?  It's a game  if I need to gm-fiat out a spell or two  maybe a race  that's fine. I'm not making a whole new class  I'm not reworking all of the spells  I'm not going to rework all of the races. That's way too much time for a game that's going to have two sessions before real life gets in the way  and I'm not paid to do it.  A good reference point is the idea that if something requires a lot of effort  there should be a big payoff to it.

543,Would like some anime recommendation where the character has a mental disorder(Joker) or any type of disability(A silent voice) and also an anime about disease outbreak(Resident evil).I just give some example so you guys have an idea about what i'm talking about. Thanks:)
544,# [Trick Call Online](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aendien.TrickCall)  Trick Call is a card game. It can be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aendien.TrickCall).  You can find the rules in the game's description on Google Play as well as in the game itself. There isn't a tutorial yet  that's still work in progress.  I uploaded a new improved version a few days ago and I am curious about general feedback.  Requirements:  1. The game currently runs on Android only. 2. You will be prompted to allow the app to record your voice. This is for the voice chat feature only. If you don't want that  you can just reject and play the game regardless.  With regard to testing your game: **Feel free to leave a link to your post or game in this thread.**  Thanks   aendien
545,**Here's a summary for anyone not familiar with this.**  **Current Blue Zones research =** identify zones with a high concentration of older-than-average  healthy people. Interview and survey the population to extract habits and consumption behaviour associated with longevity.  **Issues =** bais against some communities (e.g. US Adventists accepted as a blue zone  when US Mormons achieve similar wellbeing scores  but were not looked at)  poor/ obscure data (e.g. some Blue Zones proved to be falsely marked because of people just lying about their age) and bias against some consumption choices (e.g. meat consumption is largely dismissed  with the researchers declaring a preexisting focus on veganism).  Better research  and my questions for you =  1. **Drawing the zone around individuals  as opposed to communities.** How would you achieve this? What data would you work with to understand a more granular distribution of your population (if we take age as an example)? How could you ensure the data your marking scope on is accurate? 2. **Comprehensive understanding of lifelong habits and consumption behaviours.** How would you design a study on this? How would you ensure subject and researcher bias are kept to a minimum? How would you tease out meaningful causal links? 3.  **Gaps.** What other things would you take into consideration when starting something like this?

547,This is so Honda  just like last time. They finally got something figured out  and then they leave. Took them until now to build a competitive engine. Last time they left  they left with a championship-winning car on the drawing board.
548,Quick Q: I’ve been out of the loop for a bit but when Mark Cerny did that presentation where he showed the internals of a PS5 architecture  he showed a card that had PS1  PS2  and I think PS4 games as well... what happened to that?
549,If you want something in metal  Feng Shui coins are ideal. They're easily available on internet  quite cheap (like 20$ for a hundred of them)  and have a real nice look  weight and size. Plus  they're made of brass  so they have a nice golden colour.
550,"When I first stepped into a managerial position from a technical one  the first thing I told my staff was ""Forget I was a tecky.  I may say something technical  but you must ignore me.  You call all technical shots.  I am here to clear your management hurdles  get you guys recognized for your efforts  and look after your needs  so that you can spend your time tackling technical problems  and not the managerial and financial nonsense."""
551,"Yu throwing Kasumi's phone in the air and Ayumu struggling to catch it before it hits the ground was hilarious. Something tells me that Ayumu will wind up getting more ""Butt Monkey"" moments like that  probably because of Yu inadvertently doing something similarly silly."
552,It is a real shame that multi-GPU isn't more popular  there is so much potential there that just goes untapped  especially for multi-monitor gaming and games like MSFS 2020.  Even a 3090 will fall to it's knees trying to push 3 1440P ultra-wide monitors.  mGPU support in DX12 and Vulkan works great  but as we have seen many developers don't bother with it  and there is no way I have found to force it if the developer does not add support to the application.  Now that nVidia is dropping SLI in the driver  with no way to force something like SFR / Every other frame rendering  it is really going to suck for multi-monitor gamers as we can't build our own SLi profile.  This move doesn't just kill Sli  it kills multi-monitor gaming as well.  The real irony in all this is that we are finally seeing PCI-E Gen4 and NV-Link on consumer cards which means we FINALLY have the bandwidth to run forced SFR/Every other frame without support in the application and without the stuttering and artifacts that we would get with the old bridges. Just as the hardware is catching up to the technology  they shit can it  and it is beyond frustrating.  This sucks.
553,Hello!  I have created the biggest ambiences library in the world  and it's free :  [https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelGhelfi](https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelGhelfi)   &#x200B   You can also find it on Spotify  [https://open.spotify.com/artist/17njitvUNAIx81UoflmQyi](https://open.spotify.com/artist/17njitvUNAIx81UoflmQyi)   &#x200B   On YouTube specifically  here are 13 Sci-Fi ambiences :    [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHUA-o\_5dgK43Nyhf7nf2iKpMyNHEu7-](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHUA-o_5dgK43Nyhf7nf2iKpMyNHEu7-)   &#x200B   But many medfan ambiences do fit for Sci-fi (a desert is a desert  scif-fi or not).  &#x200B   Have fun!
554,I use an HP Pavillion for school and have blue light glasses  but I need to use my prescription glasses and it's uncomfortable to wear both pairs at the same time (I just got new frames and lenses so I'm not going to get new lenses for another year  so I can't get anything with a blue light filter yet). I've been looking for a screen protector for my PC so that I can do my work comfortably  but I can't find one that's reasonably priced with good reviews. Most that I find are advertised as blue-light-blocking  but they seem to be primarily anti-glare. I'd like to buy one for under $50 if anyone has any recommendations.
555,Because you probably won't be working on difficult/novel problems  scientifically.  In these cases  you will be able to more quickly deliver a solution by pulling together modular pieces of code that other people have already written (either internally or in open source software) rather than trying to roll your own solution. The archetype most qualified for this task is an engineer  not a scientist.
556,I get that Excel is very useful when it comes to data entry and review.  Excel’s formatting  charting and graphing capabilities make it ideal for entering and accessing data and creating reports... BUT Excel is NOT a database.
557,First timer  Episode 4 - Shadow Boxing  . Ippo is happy and thinks about starting to train everyday  . Two gym members see Ippo getting into a little incident falling and throwing some store goods thanks to not being aware of his surroundings and start thinking about helping him in his training  . The two gym members get into a discussion with Takamura because he too wanted to train him  the gym's senpai ends the discussion sending both Takamura and the two guy members to train by themselves this taking it upon him to train Ippo personally  . Ippo starts training with the gym's senpai  practicing his punch(this being called mitt-training) and improving his stamina  first getting accoustumed to the time of a round  then another...   . He asks Ippo if he wants to beat Miyata ti which he responds that he does want to making him funky aware of Miyata's presence in the gym  . Senpai teachs him a tecniche  The Uppercut. He tells him to practice Shawo Boxing too  . The two gym members get into a discussion after Ippo asks one to reach him how to practice Shadow Boxing  they both had different ways to do it and after a brief showcase of their tecniche they both get sent to a room of the gym to rest.  . Ippo begins annalyzing Miyata's fighting style  then after three days he can finally see Miyata's punches and capture his shadow in his imagination.  Episode 5 - three months to the counter  . Ippo learned about the leaning of a counter which is using an opponent's strenght  impulse  against themselves.  . Senpai tells him about the Irritation tactic  making the opponente lose his patience and using that against them.  . Ippo goes to buy boxing shoes  after seeing him be almost led up to buy a pair non ideal for his style Miyata recommends him the better  more ideal for his style ones. After that Ippo ask him to have a drink(juice) together.  . We got to know Miyata's past and journey to where he is now  it was so amazing seeing him getting developed. . Seeing Miyata's hardwork invigorated Ippo's will to continue training.  . The three months flew by but we got the sense that said time really had passed.  Episode 6 - Rematch Gong  . Ippo's mom tells him an anecdote about his dad  she said that he used to fight a lot and everytime he fought against someone who was stronger than him he saw his head as a Tuna and thought to himself that he couldn't really be' a fisherman if her was affraid of a Tuna and the tension melted away.  . The first part of the match was absolutely amazing.  Episode 7 - The destructive force of one cm  . The match continues and everything from the coreography  the music  the excitement is on point. It was wonderful how the match passed through different stages  each of Ippo and Miyata had their moments to shine. The match ended with the destructive force of one centimeter as Ippo coneccted an Uppercut barely touching Miyata's chin.   Episode 8 - Promise to meet again  . Ippo is thinking about getting closer and becoming friends with M
558,Deep neural networks consist of two parts:  - Feature extraction which is everything except the last layer.  - Classifier which is the last layer.  Autoencoders allow you to get unsupervised feature extraction (called an embedding in neural network sp33k). Layers of neural networks are interchangeable and you don't have to train them together. You can train an autoencoder to go from audio to audio  another autoencoder to go from video to video and then combine them and train the rest of the layers to do something else. Like Video + audio to video captioning.  You can also do things like anomaly detection  an autoencoder that was trained on human speech will get confused by dog barking and you can measure it and determine that this is something new.  Field of deep learning is huge precisely because you can mix&match layers from different places. You can do all kinds of weird shit which is impossible with shallow learners.
559,You see  I personally find Java annoying to use. Not to mention its better-than-python-but-still-quite-shitty performance. Is it possible to use C or (or even C++  but I like C better) for Android games?
560, >Obviously going from 100k FPS to 1 million FPS won't help anyone since it is way past limit of human reflexes  As is 60 to 120. It never was about reflexes. The time from you see something happening to your brain deciding to act to you acting takes a lot of time. Even at best case scenarios  where you are prepared  a simple click reaction provides around 150-250ms for the best competitive players. You can even test this out yourself by various response time tests from mouse clicks. So the extra saved ms in frames from 60 to 120 FPS  helps very little in terms of reaction time advantages.
561,Use the fate chart to determine what the environment and the NPCs are like  but use your PC's stats and skills to determine whether your PCs succeed at something. So yes  you still need to build out your PC if you are actually wanting to use the GME alongside D&D.
562,The 5th edition was an anniversary version  with original authors participating.  The main change is the universe  after last big campaign effects  the whole angelic bureaucracy/ demonic network disappeared. Now Angels and Demons on Earth are kind of lost on their own  without a clear hierarchy  with more reasons to blend the lines (More highlander than before).

564,When i didn't have much spare money but was foolish enough to purchase a car with summer tires i ran them through the winter  in the snow  etc.  temps got down to -10f several times that year.  Dumb idea for many reasons but it did not damage the tires in any way I got the full 20k mi out of them  just take it easy until the tires warm up  dont drive if there is ice or snow.
565,The pricing seems to wind up some people. Let's not forget the big picture. It is in every market participant's long-term interest to support the surging underdog until the market share is 50-50 and they trade blows. Only then  absent a cartel  can we buy 'best perf/dollar'. For now  '_good_ perf/dollar' still serves the health of the market  imagine you're donating the difference to the Idea of Capitalism  BTW - perf/dollar might not have decreased (much/at all) - we're getting a healthy perf boost  too!
566,Yeah but fuck my PS3 support  I'm serious. Most ps3 exclusives will be lost forever if a release or backwards compatibility don't happen soon. Like Sony i will happily pay an extra 200 for a PS5 if it has PS3 support. Like guys wtf?

568,Hopefully this kind of move makes microATX the new standard for motherboards (eventually). The ATX form factor is massive and completely unnecessary for most people - yet the vast majority of motherboards are ATX.
569,This trend has started because a bunch of programmers who don't know much statistics but managed to somehow get into DS in the early days are now trying to take the discipline to what they know best  i.e. their own comfort zone.
570,"when I hear of one star reviews being removed -it's usually because the publisher flags it as abusive or insubstantial and DTRPG agrees. Granted  there are likely a bunch of cases I haven't heard of.   Keep in mind  a lot of publishers will consider any review that's 3 stars or lower as a hit job or ""nerd rage"".   By way of comparison  when I used to work at a traditional newspaper we never published any restaurant review that was three stars or less. Local businesses would take it as a personal insult.   On a related note  someone left a slew of 3 star reviews on a bunch of Savage Worlds products a year or two ago. The SW publisher email list was lit up with folks talking about how this reviewer clearly had a grudge because they didn't like the new edition and was trying to punish 3rd parties who published for it. (It's possible they were right. Sure seemed like everyone was quick to call ""Nerd rage!"" though.)  So - the point - if you **really** want to give constructive feedback to the publisher in the hopes of helping them improve - you might consider reaching out to them discreetly on social media with constructive criticism.  For many  a public negative review is just something they're likely to take umbrage to or  brush off."
571,I'm putting together computer parts on part picker. I'm wondering if my CPU cooler will interfere with the ram on my motherboard?  Motherboard: MSI - MPG Z490 GAMING EDGE WIFI   CPU cooler: be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4  RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 32GB  Y'all are swell
572,Curious if this demand for the card means that Nvidia will launch their RTX 3060/3060ti later then expected. Would be bad for me  but finically it seems like a good way to profit. Make all the money they can selling high margin cards first to desperate people  and then serve the mid-range gaming community after.
573,So this is one I watched a while back and I remember liking it and wanted to check it out again but I don't remember what it was called.  I don't think it was super popular  but I think it was about this sort of secret militant wing of the Vatican and the main character was some sort of vampire I think. If memory serves he kinda had separate personas  one for when he was normal  and one for when he was in vampire mode.  The pope was a kid  and I remember the anime itself being a little on the darker side.  So if anyone can tell me what it was based on the nothing that I've provided here I'll be both Impressed and grateful!
574,And I think that had largely to do with lackluster character writing. Sho had next to no personality  and seemed defined by the fact that he had a heart condition (despite being able to run around without any significant problems  lol). The whole heart condition thing seemed like it was tacked on to tie in thematically with the struggles of Arrietty and her family  but it felt sloppy and like it could have been more relevant to the movie’s plot. There’s also the fact that Sho and Arrietty only actually interacted 2 or 3 times prior to the film’s climax  which didn’t feel like enough time for them to establish the bond/friendship that the movie was trying to convey. And then you have Haru  who was awful for no clear-cut reason. We never learned her motive for trying to trap Arrietty’s family  and it came out of absolute nowhere  as if halfway through the film  the writers were like “wait a second  we need a villain.” Sans Haru  it seems like Arrietty and her family wouldn’t have had to move  as Sho and his aunt were both very chill with the idea of having them live in the little dollhouse or whatever. But anyway  to me it felt like the movie dragged on to much  but didn’t establish the elements that it needed to establish for me to remain invested in what was happening.   I am prepared to be downvoted to oblivion.
575,when i turned on my pc  it showed the blue screen of death saying critical process died  when it restarts  it shows a black screen with reboot and select proper boot device. my windows 10 is on my nvme ssd and i also have a hdd. i just wanna play games  any help appreciated.
576," **Rewatcher**  Has got to be a crappy night for Jiron sleeping on the floor in that position.   Elchi's dad is a schemer. Sells people things at the bazaar  then has his subordinate Horla steal them back.   Now Elchi's getting him a job. Pretty kind considering he stole a Walker Machine from her dad.   Jiron's got a famous dad.... well at least among those who call themselves Breakers.   Zyler's figured out what's going on...  I was about to say how impressive this was with them taking out Walker Machines without piloting one themselves  then Zyler gets gunned down. So maybe not. I guess Jiron's already lost his new job.   Jiron avoids all those rocks  only for one final one to hit him in the head. The type of gag to expect from this show.  So in this show  battleships (called landships) can transform themselves into Walker Machines. Likely a key inspiration for the ships that are actually giant mechs thing in Gurren Lagann.  [Minor Spoilers](/s ""Is Kotsett being voiced by a different seiyuu here? His voice sounds a lot different than it does the rest of the show."")  Official subs making an obvious whiff here as Elchi says ""Iron Gear""  her father's flashy landship  but the subs say ""Iron Guy"".  LoL  Kotsett thinks Jiron has come to defend the Xabungle  instead he's just helping him steal it by handing over that pistol."
577,I know this is quite vauge but I figure if anyone can help it's people on this forum. I'm specifically looking for an anime where the MC and other 'villan' characters control demons. All I can remember is a fight scene with an angel on a bridge and near the final episode I think they're fighting in a church or a tempal for a crown or something???   Sorry it's so non descriptive lol
578,Anybody hear about the founder of chewy whom bought a 9% stake in GameStop at the end of August? A little sketchy on the volumes and spread  but he’s made roughly $16m in six weeks. Seems suspicious when the guy took all of his money from selling the company and put it into Wells Fargo and Apple in 2017. Doesn’t seem like an expert on market trends....

583,As a DM/GM/Storyteller/whatever  I dislike using prewritten modules. I always run my own homebrew campaigns and most of my free time is spent creating new worlds and populating them with characters that I find interesting.  That being said  it is sometimes difficult for me to come up with plot lines or adventures that my players can really get into. While I think said stories are interesting or serve a purpose  my players may disagree and get bored. It's always tough trying to find the just the right pace to keep your characters engaged  especially if it's a new party and you're not yet familiar with everyone who is playing.
584,Simple ransom. Now their friends/allies are broke and the PCs have to make it up to them. And the PCs lost loot because that is not part of the ransom.   Trying to recover heirlooms even gives you some plot hooks.
585,Hello I am an incoming 2nd year civil engineering student. I want to be a data scientist in the future. My question is that is there any way that infrastractures and buildings can generate data? Can you please tell me more on how can I use my undergrad course in relation with data science. I also plan to take masters in data science in the future. Thank you very much!
586,>yikes  m getting lots of hate for this.  1. You are dissing one of the sub's holy grail anime 2. Comedy is not the main part of the show. It's heavily subjective.

587,I know it’s not  primarily  a game dev topic but I think I’d be a cool addition to a game so......  It’s probably not a new idea or concept but I was just wondering it after watching some videos about fictional AI (SCPs) and I thought it would be a cool thing to test.  Any ideas on how this could be pulled off would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks  Josh
588,Considering how the vantage DBX and DB 11 are using AMG engines and last gen mercedes infotainment system it's been a natural progress .  The DBX even uses mercedes transmission. The top of the line V12 in DB 11 is the only Aston Martin sourced engine currently on offer.
589,Here's a hot take I'm not sure I fully agree with: I prefer bone stock 1960s Americana to just about every possible modding approach one can take with them. Restomods? Lowriders? Hot rods? All a bunch of malarkey. Give me the cleanest possible stock '65 Pontiac or something.
590,Hello   the question seems a bit moot  but I'm actually looking for 3 specific characteristics:  1. Needs to interface with AWS Athena 2. I need to be able to run customized queries using (presto) SQL and make visualizations based on those. 3. Dashboards should have permissions so I can decide which users can or cannot see them.  &#x200B   Regarding point #2  I'll go a bit more in detail: I'm currently performing little data transformation in my ETL process  as I handle the T part at a later stage  during data retrieval.  Therefore  a simple drag and drop interface is not enough for me  I need to be able to run custom queries in order to filter out specific data that I don't want or need  or transform it in a way that is readable.  E.G: since I'm using AWS Athena  and my data is stored in parquet format  some columns contain semi-structured data  such as maps or arrays of variable length. Therefore  I need to be able to use Presto SQL to parse such data and transform it so that I can visualize it.  I'm currently using Redash  but sadly it doesn't support user permission on dashboard  which means that any user that has access to a specific data source can see all dashboards that connect to that data source.  Advice?
591,Pick a random TV episode of Mission Impossible  Get Smart  or The Avengers. IF this is a meat-space game  craft up one or two props to really wow the players (for Mission Impossible  make the character sheets like the dossiers in the series).   As for a game system. really any would work.  FATE might be great  but any other Narrative Editing type stories are good for players to have some wacky spy-gadget on them ad-hoc to get out of that Shark Tank they maybe found themselves in.
592,Imagine you are trying to hire someone and you see someone with 1 year of experience.  Okay... so does everyone else.  You have a not-so-relevant degree.... so does everyone else.   You don't have a github portfolio... but everyone else does. Into the trash your resume goes!   It's not like your github portfolio will matter when the competition had a PhD in machine learning and 5 NeurIPS publications and 4 internships at some fancy R&D labs (openAI  Tesla  Google etc.).  But when all things are roughly equal and you're one of the top candidates for consideration  a github portfolio matters quite a lot.
593,What do you/they mean by business experience? Just hands on  in industry application of data analysis/science knowlege? If so  build a small portfolio of prescriptive analyses. This shows that you can do the type of work which benefits a business internally to foster efficiency. You might not have that true in industry experience  but it shows you know how to take their data and provide insight to improve performance. Also  as others have advised  you have a strong educational background which shows your adaptability and ability to learn and transfer those out of industry skills to the benefit of a company. Good luck!
594,Start by creating the public content. I am personally doing this like here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAkMseNyiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMAkMseNyiw)  Can be anything  videos  blogs  posts to Reddit...  Point is to create an **engaged** audience first  before worrying about anything else. Otherwise  it's likely that you will end up spending time and money on something that nobody cares about.

596,I kinda ran into the same problem about 2 months ago when reading the submission of COVID 19 research paper. The person tried write many line of codes but all of them are useless and something that is useable at the end of the day can be summed up in around 30 lines of codes  repeat them 20 times. The approach is quite blank and simple which also means signicantly flawed. But then people actually compliment her on doing a good job and having clean codes🤡🤡🤡 .   I guess we have to take everything with a grain of salt. Kaggle is just a datasets storage house and answers are nothing more than approach  recommendations. Better to check the ones that get the prize from Competitions or from actual credited individials. I dont submit project on Kaggle but rather publish it on DS blog
597,Dude S is just low specs... It does matter. X is so much superior than S.   But I know they want S to sell more than X cause of ps5 and switch. But I think S is gonna be good for a while later down the line it's not going to be same.  Its already on low end for future specs. If anything just get X.

While I don't wanna detract from amd achievements  zen core is nothing out of the ordinary and didn't bring any new groundbreaking techniques like for example sandy bridge brought the uop fusion. Amd current succes is in not an insignificant amount thanks to intel being basically idle for 5 years allowing AMD to catch up. Give intel access to a great process and things will be very different.
600,Hello I’m doing a large research project (large for me at least) about big data and psychographics and some more things along those lines. Anyways I’m in need of a “expert adviser” basically what that means is someone I can talk to about my research who is an expert in this field and can give me pointers and tips on my research. This is the first time I’ve done an academic project on this subject specifically and even if you don’t want to become my expert advisor some tips on things to look at would be greatly appreciated. I don’t 100% know where I’m going with this research yet weather it be ethics or attempting to creat an algorithm but I do have a few ideas. If you would like to know you can dm me or send me a chat. I don’t particularly like commenting and using the comment section in general. But if you decide to comment I’ll probably reply
601,I think we are heading towards luxury cars to have almost augmented reality Head Up Displays. It will be bad when the windshield cracks  but cool when it is working.   I also agree with JoyRydr's idea of power hybrids or electric.
602,I don't think anyone expected these to be fantastic value for the cost vs. existing Radeon VII owners  or 5700 owners too for that matter.  At least these cards can be decent value for gamers who'd like to mine some extra coin on the side when their machines are idle  with power profiles in place.
603,I don't really understand what's so upsetting about all this. Everybody who wants one and can pay for it will be able to get the card eventually. This isn't like a concert or something where now you can't go  right?
604,I’d say your intuition is correct. Your time is much better spent on Python or R  even if it has to be outside the classroom. But I’m curious if others disagree because I’ve always been prejudiced. SAS felt old when I was starting out in this field 7 years ago. I always saw a clear divide between young people who could be creative and agile in R/Python vs. moderately competent middle aged people who just merely got by and refused to look beyond SAS. Sort of an old dog/new tricks dynamic.
605,"I chose statistics at the very last semester of my undergrad  because I was originally interested in math. I didn't appreciate how much handwaving was done in actuarial science classes  and at the same time  while I really liked real analysis and abstract algebra  I knew that there would be a way to connect these pure math courses to more ""applied"" fields. Statistics was a natural compromise between these two mindsets for me.  Would I switch my focus? No. But at the same time  I don't want to be seen as a stats person who doesn't know how to program: my masters final project was a time series bootstrapping project that was done using Java and AWS.   I view computer science as a tool to help me do my stats better. I am not interested enough in CS to study CS for the sake of studying CS. This is not the case with stats or math."
606,Mercedes build quality is unfortunately going down  not what I expect from Mercedes or a German brand. In the C Class  interior trims pieces creak and rattle. In their cheaper cars like the CLA  some things even [wobble](https://youtu.be/gmP4ARI_uiU?t=115). I'm not saying its a Lada but its concerning and currently for the price  maybe I can let it go but if this continues to get worse  it would definitely make me shortlist Mercedes if I was a buyer.
607,I'm looking for a intelligent-jerking anime  where the protagonist overcomes everything with his/her intelligence and sees through every trick.   &#x200B   One Outs is a perfect example for what I'm looking for. Something like Death Note is also good but the difference between it and One Outs is  in One Outs protagonist never really feels cornered  he just outsmarts anyone and everyone. This is actually a bad thing story-wise  it's very unrealistic and reduces conflicts  shock effect etc. but nowadays I crave something like that.  &#x200B   &#x200B   Things I tried and willing to watch   Read Liar's Game a bit  didn't like it much.  Thinking about starting Kaiji or Code Geass  but I'm not a fan of both of them from what I know about them right now.
608,I don't think so.  I think what we're observing is that a few similar (but different) roles were being referred to as 'data science'  while now some of those are splintering off into their own dedicated roles... like machine learning engineers and data analytics engineers.    The essence of data science is *science*  which is to say it is knowledge discovery through the scientific method.  It is pretty common in any scientific field for discoveries to translate into new application opportunities which require engineering.  I think that's basically what we're seeing happen in data science  with the application phase having initially been an outgrowth of the data scientist function itself but ultimately evolved into a standalone engineering role.  I think we'll continue to see the emergence of ML engineers  AI engineers  etc  while the data scientist role will concentrate on knowledge discovery and decision making.  That likely entails an emphasis on experimental design  hypothesis testing  and statistical inference that is more explanatory modeling than predictive modeling.  In terms of organization  your ML engineers probably are likely to drift closer to your traditional software engineering units within the org  while your data scientists are likely to continue to maintain less certain orbits that tend to be associated with product and QA teams (sometimes all under the same roof as engineering  sometimes located elsewhere  sometimes some hybrid mix  etc).
609,"Player was trying to shmooze his way into keeping his staff at a no-weapons party (the whole Gandalf  don't separate an old man from his walking stick thing) but rolls a nat 1. I'm about to narrate how he just goofs it up completely and the guards will be keeping an eye on him when he declares ""I just shit myself. It is loud and smelly and obvious to everyone."" Who am I to tell my player ""No""? He ends up refusing to clean himself up so the guards drag him to a bathroom so he can clean himself up  leaving a trail of poo behind him. It definitely gave the rest of the party an opening get in without being seen."
610,I had to think on this before gathering my thoughts.  I think most of Bethesda's titles could probably stand to benefit from the deal. If nothing else  they could get worse (ouch). But I'm more worried about possible decrease in quality from the better studios under the umbrella- Arkane and Id. I hope I'm wrong.

612,My dad since he got the current car that he drives (2006) he has gone only to the authorized Mitsubishi repair shop which is 45km away  I have to say that he most likely has payed his car again in repairs. Last week he had a problem so he went to the authorized repair shop  they told him that the fix will cost him 700€. He came back and asked some friends if they knew any good local mechanic  one of them told him for a bald mechanic who is drunk sometimes. He went there the other day and he repaired his car problem for only 15€  my dad gave him 20 and left
613,At least this time the baseball episode was at the start... or didn't it count?  By the way  I wonder if it turns out that Odin's prophecies are just made up and they overtook the bus by pure chance. That would be a plot twist.
614,Anyone care to speculate on how this will effect the upcoming laptop sales we typically see during Q4?  If they don't have inventory  there's no point in having sales. On the other hand  if they think people have already bought a ton of laptops and there are fewer buyers  they might have to make the sales better to attract buyers.
615,"Most ""generic RPGs"" are just ""universal combat engines"". If you want a generic system that works for more than just combat  those are a bit harder to come by.  Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard resolve non-combat conflicts in the same way as combat ones  although they are a bit hard to use as-is. BW is especially heavy.  Fellowship is a pretty good universal system  but it's PbtA. It also has somewhat universal conflicts. It's pretty good for fantasy and science fantasy  especially stuff like LotR  Avatar the Last Airbender  Star Wars.  Cortex is an engine that lets you build tailor systems for what you need. There are a lot of optional rules you can plug in and out. That being said  it involves a lot of dice tricks and can be pretty bland at times.  FATE is pretty universal  but I haven't had much experience with it to have an opinion.  Chuubo's is also pretty flexible  although it's best suited for more pastoral  ghibli-esque games. That being said  the system is heavy on the crunch side of things and it's really hard to get into due to how it's written  so it's a bit of an oxymoron."
616,Never buy a Chinese manufactured car. Just don’t do it. These people are lucky it didn’t catch on fire. The wiring is probably held together with inadequate solder  connected without proper shielding  and using incorrect gauge.
617,The big joker in the deck is that I fully expect MS to try and implement their own ML upscaling solution at some point into the DX12U standard across both PC and XBOX  possibly without needing fuckery by devs.  Consoles NEED this tech.
618,The beauty of Pathfinder is that they have more premade content than you can use in a single game. So in terms of world-building  campaign design  and everything you can just pick a module and go fairly easily.    Have a degree of comfort with the rules. Know the overall flow of the story you're going to tell (read the modules).    The most important is have fun. You don't need to be perfect.
619,Masters of Umdar  Knights of Invasion  John Carter and pastiches (Savage Mars)  Flash Gordon and Pastiches (Slipstream)  Astonishing Swordsmen and Sorcerers of Hyperborea has some of this stuff  The Numeria region of Pathfinder  the Purple Planet modules of DCC  Mutant Crawl Classics  Barbarians vs Vile Reptillian Invaders from Outer Space (Comedy game there)...     For non-RPGs I'd look into short stories by Clark Ashton Smith  and HP Lovecraft as well as the entire 'planetary romance' genre such as John Carter  Planet of Adventure  and the Columbus of Space.
620,I can see 8k like panels in the future (5+ years) for VR  with high angle vision (140º+) and foveated rendering  so you will only use the full resolution in the area you are looking at.   I don't see it all that apealing for TV and  monitors  unless you want a HUGE TV or a 40'+ monitor  and in the monitor case I think it is better going ultra wide 2160p.
621,Okay. This maybe be a dumb question and I see it popping up a lot in this thread. What is the difference between data science and applied statistics. I totally understand deep learning vs stats. I’ve seen people called linear regression machine learning. I mean even an xgboost model is just a super binary based model like a logistic model?
622,Easy way to diagnose the fans:  Disconnect them one at a time and whichever is off when the noise goes away  replace that one. You can do this with the cpu fan as well  just dont leave it running for more than a few minutes  you'll get a cpu fan error in post but that's normal if its disconnected.
623,Location: Florida  US  Price range: $2-3.5k  New or used: Used  Type of Vehicle: Hatchback  Coupe  Sedan  Must Haves: Fun to drive  reliable and easy to work on  good aftermarket support  Desired transmission (auto/manual  etc): manual  Intended use: daily driving and a trip up the east coast and back to New England once or twice a year  Vehicles you’ve already considered: NB Miata  6th gen Civic Hatch  Is this your 1st vehicle: No  Do you need a Warranty: No  Can you do minor work on your own vehicle: Yes  Can you do Major work on your vehicle: Yes  Additional Notes: I like having full control of whatever I'm operating whether that be a phone  computer  or car so I got drawn to manual cars. I currently drive an automatic Honda Fit that I've been getting a bit sick of since my 45 minute commute consists of a lot of highway driving  and I'd like to have something a bit quicker to not worry about overtaking at lower speeds as much. I would plan on driving the car I buy on 1000+ mile road trips on occasion so being able to do maintenance for cheap by myself is a must.  I feel like the two cars I've narrowed it down to are suitable for what my needs are  however I'm still not sure which one I should choose of the two or if there are any other options that I'm not considering.  Thank you!
624,"I'll echo others and say ""it's an rpg  you can do what you want""  HOWEVER   One thing to keep in mind is that if you're running a game in an established universe that diverges majorly in tone or lore from the standard setting  you're going to want to make that very clear from the outset.   Otherwise  you'll get people who want a more classic grimdark experience and will be (justifiably) annoyed when you fail to deliver  and you'll likely scare off players who would have enjoyed what you're offering"
625,So let me upvote this first  say some crap because I’m also an EE and designed GHz chips for the last decade and a half  before I go back and read your article in detail.  PDN design on silicon just gets worse every node thanks to copper interconnect pitch that shrinks to match the transistor shrink. Even if your PCB level power delivery network can deliver to spec at the input to the die pad  you’re still trying to squeeze all that current through an ever shrinking pipe. Well  the inner diameter shrinks but outer diameter cannot do so at same rate because cladding to prevent the copper from polluting the rest of the materials during fan can’t go down further.  Ok  back to reading. Thanks for writing this!

628,I see the epic fans throwing around that Apple is a monopoly. It doesn’t track they have the smallest percent of computer and of phones. Android and windows beat them on both accounts. Apple is a close eco system and you can agree or not agree with it  but at the end of the day both consumers and business have a choice to buy and support their products. I hope epic has to pay out the ass for abusing the legal system.
629,Man.  First glance is the wheels look good  then look again and Jeep has used miserably small disks & calipers for a vehicle that size.  Those brakes should be a completely different class for that segment.   Wonder where else they cut it short where it's really supposed to count.

632,"brings us to the main stuff: How to get at least 5 000 000 Facebook pages indexed in Solr  and processed with MLib  to extract the 500 000 pages?  Let me explain what I'm going to do. I'm going to ""somehow"" get 5 000 000 Facebook IDs  and use Graph API to extract their data into Solr docs  then use Solr itself to trim it down  thn use Spark's MLib to trim it down further. BUT... How in the name of God amd I gonna get 5 000 000+ Facebook IDs?  &#x200B   I already have 27 000 ""relevant"" Facebook links I got from CSE.

635,Happy birthday to your dad!  You could get him a premium subscription to something like [Statista](https://www.statista.com/). I know that I personally would have enjoyed being able to download and play with a ton of random datasets.   Maybe there's something you could do with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) as a gift? But maybe your dad already uses it. Either way  please do let us know what you decided to get him! :)
636,Hmm while I find other comments to be encouraging and you should listen I think they are missing one important aspect. If you are getting refused in later interview stage the reason is likely interview performance compared to others. Yes resume experience can be a factor but as a company you don't invest so much time in a candidate you could have refused based on CV alone.  My guess is that the companies are interested first but during later interviews your lack of experience shows. I can't really pinpoint where because Im not an observer but maybe you can pinpoint cases where the questions or technical tests did not go that well and someone with just a bit more exp or simply better at interviewing got the job.  Do you feel extra nervous and do blunders or do you feel you re acing interviews ? Maybe you're too honest in interviews. While you should not lie or say ignorant stuff on a topic you know nothing  it is good advice to make you look better in interviews than what you truly are. Maybe for technicals you lack practice with the tools and therefore you make mistakes or work too slow ? You're competing for entry level work based on your description and this level is very competitive.  If it makes you feel better my first job took me 5months and 7 interviews to get. And in retrospective I probably missed half of them due to poor interview skills.
637,I doubt there will be any practical advantage above 120FPS  as going from 120 to 240FPS can be effectively used by less than 0.01% of human population due to biological limits.  I'd be more curious about Direct Brain Interface  AKA brain plug.
638,***Just my $0.02...***  You see data science was all fancy when big companies started exploring what they can do with their data 6-7 years ago. Over the years they invested lots of money and time to make tools that can automate stuff for them. EDA became handy using tools and libraries.   Now all the companies already knows what are the use cases of their data. Even their engineers can start playing with basic ML models using drag and drop style tools  check Amazon ML stack or Google ML APIs.   Thing is  they realized it's not rocket science to get a sense of data  domain\_experts/engineers with some knowledge of popular framework can do that.  What they don't have is people who can transform that insight into product. Production level code require ML Engineering expertise. I see no clear differentiation between ML Engineer and Data scientist in coming years. At least for the low/mid size companies. For large corporations  they will have these roles separately but for example what happened this year  lockdown/layoffs/etc  they might try to combine these roles into more general one to save resources. Future is automated and job titles get extinct thanks to all the hard work people did to convert the power of tons of data into magical black box that can do better job doing stuff than rule based systems. I think everyone should re-evaluate their job duties every year to make sure they are not lagging behind with what's happening in their field.
639,"When it's on an LCD and it happens short-term  it's usually called ""image retention"" or ""image persistence"". We don't really have a clear idea of what causes it or why it happens. It may be caused by a number of factors such as defective panels  static electricity buildup  or even simply the LCD panel being too hot or too cold.  If you're under warranty and you can get it repaired or replaced for free  that might be your best bet."
640,You can tell who the people are who remember when a game was released as a complete title with maybe one expansion  and those who have been raised to accept this complete con as normal practice in the business. So many people justifying this bollocks with “but the extra characters are free!”. This business has become all about minimum work for maximum profit  that’s the only reason they’re adopting this business model These extra characters are the minimal work for what they expect to be huge proceeds in battle pass profit. I cannot wait for this year’s SWB2 / Fallout 76 / Anthem to get the pasting it deserves.
641,Well these are some Gleipnir level threads for an established show  low karma low comment. Is this season so far not worth checking out?   Gleipnir was  but it had freshness to suck me in  whereas Mahouka as a sequel has to meet the standards set by S1. I won't watch another Log Horizon S2 or SAO S2 so gonna need some praise.
642,It's as hard on it as you let it be. The key takeaway for me when I teach someone manual is not getting them into the habit of slipping the shit out of the clutch to get going. That's the exact thing that leads to excessive clutch wear  and it's poor form.  That said  the limited time here kind of mitigates any wear concerns. Even if she's dailying it for two weeks  I think there's unlikely to be the any substantial extra wear unless she's the slippingest driver of all time.
643,As far as I know there are no hydrogen fuel stations anywhere remotely in my area therefore I don't own nor personally know someone that owns one. So I guess that's gonna be your biggest con - exceptionally small area where you can live with one - mainly in CA.   Also just want to make OP aware that Alex on Autos (youtube channel) has a long term Hyundai Nexo that they already did a couple videos on. Might be relevant toy our interests.
644,Preach.  I drank every night I used it in grad school.  Someone on a thread a while back pointed out that learning SAS teaches you nothing other than how to use SAS.  It's so clunky and ancient that almost nothing in it transfers to learning another language.  For 99% of use cases  the only reason to use SAS is that everyone you're working with uses SAS and your org relies on SAS scripts going back to the Reagan Administration.  However  there are two things SAS is better at than R and Python:  Mixed models  and working with large datasets.  SAS's support for complex error structures in mixed effects models is unparalleled  and it also fits them quickly.  Additionally  SAS comes from a time when memory was scarce  so it processes data one line at a time without reading all of it into memory.
645,Fluff. I am horrible at fluff- I can't do voices  I often forget to share details that aren't directly related to the point  and generally- people don't get names. My group works with it- we did a 2 year stint where 'names' were just descriptions- That guy is the Knight  shes the Enchantress  ect. It worked fine sure  but names probably would have increased connections.
646,I had pirelli p zeros and those got SCARY below 50. Any rain and temps below 65 forget it. I wouldn’t worry about cracking but I’d definitely be concerned about grip. I nearly slid into another car and the next day threw all seasons on.
647,I am still surprised that GN haven't 'copied' DigitalFoundrys method of showing the FPS real time as it is a way better way of showing performance differences. They have shown time and time again that the in the moment FPS delta is often much more useful than an average which can sometimes not tell the whole story.  I know GN do frametime graphs (which is the same thing) but it's impossible to fit more than 30 seconds on screen without the graph being too compact to actually see any meaningful difference.
648,I have been thinking and I am now convinced that there is a major Fallout: New Vegas geek at Microsoft who infiltrated his way to the top and brokered this deal just to unite Obsidian and Bethesda to make either a New Vegas Remaster or New Vegas 2.
649,"So actually someone did give me a piece of advice early on that I find very valuable still.  It was early in my ""RP career""  and I was really self conscious about it and I asked a more experienced friend we played with if I was ""roleplaying good"" and if I was being a ""good player"". She answered:  >*Your worth as a Player is in what you bring to the table*  This idea is very obvious  of course  but having it stated like this to my face was very valuable for my understanding of what actually matters.  For example  long ass detailed backstory? Worthless if you can't expect others to read it and care for it. My backstories these days are a couple of paragraphs long.  Complex characters? That's only in your head  for everyone else they are only what you actually show to the table  and even then really only to an extent that's usable for their characters. All of that is also limited to how much sessions have time for banter and stuff. Better focus on easily understandable ideas  easily emotionally readable characters and building relationships with other's characters."
650,Japanese cars of today have such small displacement engines compared to their European and American counterparts. Anything under 2 liters you're not going to get much power with expensive modifications.. There just isn't enough displacement to create anything that would blow away a stock performance car. Weight is a major factor  but a 1.6 liter turbo is still not going to produce enough power to overcome a 2.4/5 liter or 3.0 liter twin turbo charged engine  even if the car weighs 500 lbs more. The Japanese cars also don't have the suspension and the aftermarket brakes to compete  which is why the used a German cars have taken over in the tuner scene.
651,The above table in incomplete. You must include a temperature column. Talking about noise levels is incomplete if you don't mention what is the temp that the fans target. Why? Because they are coupled together by the target fan curve which is pre-programmed in the BIOS.  From this analysis ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRp5j4LzQsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRp5j4LzQsU))  it seems that both the Trio and the TUF achieve the same temp at the same noise level.
652,There are a few different routes you could take to deliver a Data Product to a client. Depending on the database  the procedure varies. I'll cover the procedure I take with PostgreSQL  * Export the data into database dumps * Create a docker-compose file with the exact database version so the client doesn't need to do much to reset the data * Include a script to re-import the data  If the database is over 100gb  the details in the script change to pull data down from a cloud provider
653,To everyone who missed Screenshot Saturday again but still wants to show off his game this weekend:   Share an image of your game in the comments in form of a 'How it started vs how it ended' or a 'How it started vs how its going'. These are hashtags on twitter  where people show off progression of themselves or of their projects.
654,"Something feels off here.  At least one test should go near the 20%. I wonder what happens here:  \- too big power draw and they had to downclock it or lower the memory timings?  \- the additional memory chips bring the performance penalty outside the increased power draw  &#x200B   Maybe iit will be sold ""as is"" so nobody blames NV for releasing a super power hungry card? The paper specs looks wrong. +14GB of memory and substantially more active transistors and just 320W vs. 350W TDP looked suspicious from the start.  I hope it gets up to +20% after overclocking  even if it means +100W over 3080  and 3080 after OC can easily cross 350W at stresstests  so it would mean WC being mandatory  but I don't care. I want to see how far the technology goes. And if you compare the good versions of 2080Ti after overclocking  it gets really way to close to 3080 to make it a worthy upgrade for the owners of those ""best of 2080Ti"" cards."
655,If the water damaged anything  it would usually be apparent by now. I wouldn't take it to an IT repair shop -- the money is better spent on making sure you have data backups. So yeah  are you doing data backups regularly to a flash drive  external drive  or cloud storage?
656,I have the above listed car and a pioneer car radio.  I have used the normal radio function a lot  and wanted to try spotify via AUX connecting to my samsung a71. The radio is fine at volume 20  but when i plug in AUX and use volume 20 the volume it produces is low.   I tried the following things:  max volume  its louder but still low.  check if media volume on phone is max.  check the audio cable.  check the car radio settings to make check for AUX volume settings (there are not)  Bleutooth sadly is not option on this car radio. I saw people talk about a bleutooth adapter that changes the bleutooth signal into a radio signal to still listen to the phone but i would rather not use this method. Do you guys have an idea?  sorry for bad grammer or typos im not a native speaker.
657,Hey everyone!   I am trying to do some market research for my upcoming mobile game. I was wondering if there is a way I could find the distribution of users by age for a specific game on Google Play / App Store. I am hoping to do better targeting with this information  so any advice would be much appreciated!   Thanks in advance!
658,I've just started getting into anime and am really enjoying it  however idk what exactly is good and what isn't. I've watched castlvania  attack on titan  sword art online  and death note. And I'm currently watching Jojos bizarre adventure. But after that idk what to watch. Ive been told hunter x hunter and haiku are good. Is that true? If so what else would you guys add to my list? If not  what should I watch after jojo?
659,Not an expert here but I have tasks like that and I much prefr using Python (or you could even use R) than Excel. For me (I use both Windows and Mac) excel is more often very slow than fast and especially if you want yoir steps to he reproducable  then using code is much better imo. I guess you could use macros/VBA but tbh I just think excel is not a very efficient IDE.  But I think generally  if you're efficient with your process and don't know coding yet then you would wanna think about whether it's worth the time investment to learn say python or if it would be more of an inconvenience given the learning curve.  Again  not a professional data scientist here but I do use python at work for tasks like that as well :)
660,Will leave this quote for you from [an old blog post](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)  >As far as anyone I know can tell  false negatives are completely random  and are unrelated to your skills or qualifications. They can happen from a variety of factors  including but not limited to:  >1. you're having an off day >2. one or more of your interviewers is having an off day >3. there were communication issues invisible to you and/or one or more of the interviewers > 4. you got unlucky and got an Interview Anti-Loop
661,The hatch still looks weird to me  it has some bad angles IMO. Wish they’d tweak it in a mid cycle refresh. If the hatch were just a little less weird looking plus turbo plus manual transmission would be an insta buy from me.
662,Panel fitment issues happen with all cars unfortunately. I know a professional detailer who deals with tons of customers who have high end exotics and he told me that he sees paint issues and panel gap issues from all of them.  Not an expert but I believe the panel gap and fitment issues happen because of some fluctuations in temperature during manufacturing
663,"Reddit: nVidia has such paper launches! They should have postponed to fight scalpers!  Also Reddit: nVidia is postponing the launch to mess with AMD's launch!  I can already see the headlines here if AMD's launch fails for any reason: It's not AMD's fault but nVidia's because they ""messed with it""."
664,Today  a female driver burnt alive in her Skoda because of three morons in 2 Lamborghinis and one Porsche that were doing the same thing like in this video.  More  there is a video of a guy side swiping someone who was changing lanes while he was coming with greater speed from behind. Instead of braking (you can see the intention of the other driver early enough)  he starts flashing the headlights at him and only brakes almost at the impact  despite having had enough time to brake before or enough room to the left to drive by without contact. But he panicked and froze  like all inexperienced drivers do at high speeds.  As in that video  in this too  youngsters are driving press/fleet cars at a lot higher speeds than they are used to. You can see how he clutches the wheel. I can tell he has no experience driving at this speeds.  Speed kills. Don't race on the highways/autobahn. And more important  don't drive fast with borrowed cars or if you don't have any experience driving at higher speeds.
665,Stop being a crybaby and make a better game  if he beats you to it and makes a better game  then I will buy his instead of yours. The beauty of the free market is that it is up to the consumer to decide what product to buy  and it is up to you to provide that for them  just make it better than him and your problem is solved
666,"Consumer mobos supporting PCIe 4.0 just came out this year. PCIe 4.0 SSDs just came out this year. There are already very few use cases where PCIe 4.0 provides and advantage over PCI 3.0  so why are we already talking about PCIe 5.0 in the consumer market? Am I missing something here?  Is it just a case of companies trying to get ahead of one another with ""bigger numbers"" or is there an actual technical reason for why this is happening?"
667,Rolemaster gets pretty out there pretty quickly. Character creation is INVOLVED and requires summarizing a lot of bonuses from lots of different sources (character background  pre-career training  character class  etc. In the regards to how many bonuses you have to account for  RM reminds me a bit of the Palladium System.)   Playing has its own complexities  with multiple types of maneuvers/combat actions/skill usages that all change depending on whether you are standing still or moving  and  if you are moving  how fast you are moving. Then there are the attack resolution charts which are all dependent on the type of weapon you use  modified by the type of armor your target has and your target's size. And then the very dense (but very flavorful) magic rules.  That being said  I like Rolemaster a lot  and if I were looking for a genre-specific fantasy game to play (I like generic systems too much  especially Hero  BRP  and GURPS)  it would probably be Rolemaster. Still  RM does have rules for Sci-fi and Modern Adventure  so it tries to stretch its wings a bit.
668,I don't do much statsy causality stuff but I do know that analyzing lagged independent variables w unshifted dependent variables is a thing. This is an astoundingly good review of the topic for a towards data science post https://towardsdatascience.com/inferring-causality-in-time-series-data-b8b75fe52c46
669,Is anyone interested in studying data science / ML together? I am a full-time data scientist but am looking to go to a better company. Like everyone else I study the field constantly. I am looking for someone who would be interested in meeting once a week to quiz each other and discuss the core ideas and implementations from the field but at a more advanced level. E.g.  probability / information theory  the Goodfellow book's first few chapters  optimization  clustering  regression  class imbalance etc.. I'm looking for someone with an interest in the math of it and not just the basic concepts. DM if interested!
670,Anime isn't a genre though  it's just a word to describe all Japanese animated works. Anime can be broken down into the usual genres that other films and television can as well such as horror  action  adventure  etc  EDIT: ok since i see you're just referring to streaming services' categorization  I don't really take any issue with it. People who use the service mainly for anime stand to benefit from being able to filter anime series only  and anime will still pop up in other genre categories when appropriate.
671,"It can be Isekai but I don't care I just want an anime who has those **4 words** jumbled up that's adapted from a LN/Manga. (It's easier to read manga which is less censored and more content).  It could be Trashy Ecchi or Generic Harem or Trashy Harem or Generic Trashy Ecchi or Ecchi Harem etc... Some examples:  Hundred: Love the character design from Claire (Blonde Waterboobloons crazy hair) and Emilia (Neko hair).  Masou Gakuen: Boldness with in your face tits and ass. Very creative and sexually involved with a kinda interesting plot and power system.  Rouge Hero: Big Boobs ""Sister"" and lewd lesbians side characters who are all assaulted by OP mc.  Killing Bites: Great furry anime with lots of females animals. I love the phrase ""The one with the sharpest fang wins"" it's so generic and boring makes me love Hitomi more.  Trinity Seven: So many lolis you can only peak one. Levi and Lisstete are a great pair of lewd petite who like to taunt their opponent.  I want trashy anime who know they are trash and don't hide it. If it gets too much into the story it starts to piss me off. By the way I want seasonal trash. I've seen all the popular ecchi anime (HotD  Hdxd  Qwaser  Queen's  Keijo  S-Girls etc..) But I don't follow season shows from the last 10...what...20years? You guys know best so please help me our find those date a live and absolute duo gargabe shows. I want to see those ""I dropped this because it was just tits and ass followd by pantsu and loli bath scenes"". Eromanga sensei etc...  Thanks."
672,Are we on the AMD sandbagging train again? Sigh...  Look  I want a high-end card as much as the next person. But if the data doesn't support it then don't act all disappointed when the release happens...  We thought big polaris was coming despite leaks showing otherwise. We thought big Navi was coming despite leaks showing otherwise. We thought AMD was hiding Vega's true potential too hoping upon hoping it wouldn't be a disappointment. Can you tell me what's different now??  The now leaked ashes bench shows a card on par with the 2080Ti and people are saying it's got to be Navi 22... Why?  We better strap up  we might be in for another hype train derailment....  We have no reason to believe AMD has a wide bus and no signs have pointed to HBM or other exotic memory config. We got nothing...
673,When it comes to 2D  it's only Unity or Godot. Many will say Unity because that's what most people are using. But it's kinda hard to learn compared to Godot.  Also  if you are only a single dev then I would say you alone won't be enough to make use of full potential of Unity.  So in conclusion  use Godot.
674,> Techies hailed USB-C as the future of cables when it hit the mainstream market  > How any normal person is supposed to grasp this soup of standards  No but you see  it's the techies' fault. If only it were normal people designing it  it would have been fine. Techies aren't normal people!
675,so there's only a handful of games that could even run at 60 FPS on an Xbox one  nominally  before slowdowns instead of a 30 FPS lock. so when we double the frame rate of most games all we get is 60 FPS? at 900p or whatever goofy resolution?  That's all this thing can do? and it can upscale games from the original 2001 Xbox all the way to 1440p  wow.
676,Make the props in Maya and assemble the final scene in the engine.  That way  if you need to move a tree  you can just move it. No need to launch Maya  move the tree  export it  and import it back. You can also take advantage of asset reuse  and even use mesh instancing to increase performance.  Speaking of performance  LOD and culling works on a per-mesh basis  so you don't want everything to be a single mesh. In fact  you want to split things up down to splitting a building into walls  floors and roofs.
677,Recommended specs for running Blender is:  * 64-bit quad core CPU * 16 GB RAM * Full HD display * Three button mouse or pen+tablet * Graphics card with 4 GB RAM  A laptop with an i5 and GTX 1650 you would meet the CPU and GPU recommended specs. The last req would be the RAM.
678,Use PlugShare.com to see what chargers are in your area. J1772 is the “regular” charger that every EV uses. L2 charging from empty will take a couple hours. I would make sure the Bolt has the DCFC option. That’s the DCFC Combo/CCS plug and will let you charge 0-80 in 40min or so.  Public chargers are somewhat spotty but have gotten much better in the past couple years.
679,it's a non-issue  SSD's are a lot more robust than you think. Also  the 600tb over 5 years is the warranty period  many  probably the majority would easily do double that before burning through its over-provisioning and experiencing issues.
680,I don't get people bringing things up  just to tear it up. Like  why? Just ignore it and move on. Comedy is largely subjective  at any rate. What you might find funny  I might not. Or what I find funny  you might not.
681,This scene really made me question MHA’s writing  ngl. Kirishima has a flashback to “I want to protect people” and then gets a power up from it. It was very well animated but I feel like most shows wouldn’t get a pass for that.
682,My flaw is improvisation. I have a very hard time running modules for that reason  I don't know the characters. When I DM I have always run homebrew and my DM notes have been like 80 pages or more. I need to know the whole world  the political struggles  the ties each faction leader has to another faction leader  and so on. I can't just come up with something on the fly. I need hard documentation for everything.

684,"Neither?  Ambition isn't directly related to the genre  and definitely not the 'bit-size' of your sprites  it's how complex these things -code and art- are.  For example  you say ""'AI' squadmates"".  Does that AI mean they move randomly  without player input?  Or they're 'smart' enough to move directly towards a sound/site/goal?  Or better yet  they move *carefully* towards some stimulus  taking cover?   AI  like most systems  can always be improved  so there's no end to the complexity unless you limit the scope of it.  But there's a *vast* difference between making an automated player move along a map randomly and making it behave in a player-like way.   And a 'sci-fi' 2D platformer -- if it's 'just' jump and move  great.  Start adding in lots of other things  like those optional upgrades  it gets more complex.     The general recommendation is to make something *very* simple - from a Tic-Tac-Toe game to a Pac-Man clone.  Learn how the systems (control  gameplay  rendering  etc) all work together.  *Then* try something harder.   That said  I'm a big fan of doing what you're passionate about... if one of your ideas is what drives you  fine.  But start sketching things out  or writing code  or making graphics  and *limit the scope* of what you're trying to do.    Good luck!"
685,> One of my bosses started treating me differently from the rest of the team. I still don't really know why. Maybe I stepped into some office politics I shouldn't have? No clue  but he'd single me out  shoot me down at any opportunity  or just ignore me at the best of times.  I'm pretty sure that's it. I've heard similiar stories from paris where people seemed to step too far by making (reasonable) suggestions.  They got the option to go to romania (or somewhere) so they can abuse the contract system or they won't get a new contract.  I was never an Ubisoft employee  so i was not there. Take it with a grain of salt.  But i believe you and think that's maybe what you did.  e/ This was many years ago  not recently.
686,I work in car sales. People think the salespeople are the ones who mostly screw you over  but in reality it's usually the service department. Most competent dealerships make the vast majority of their profits from service  and the prices are an absolute ripoff for service that is highly variable in quality.  Independent mechanics are absolutely the way to go.
687,i once saw a trailer for the blueray and dvd version of it  i thought it was interesting  though right now i forgot the name and i need help  the name of the anime starts with ''Detective'' and its about a little girl dressed up in green-red  i dont remember more but i guess it looked interesting (no  its not detective conan)
688,Max q means worse performance than desktop. So your initial question doesnt even make sense in the first place.  But no  laptop skus of the 3080 will not be remotely comparable to the desktop version.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YLNXAgmwY

690,Can I download my current library onto the PS5 on day 1?
691,"If you have repeat customers  There's a reason.  That said  you mentioned prep and responsibility.  So lighten your load and share the responsibility for the prep and the fun at the table.  Alot of the ""pressure"" GMs feel comes from the fact that they treat the event like a one-man show.  They feel like they need to provide the venue  the food  the ambience  the entertainment  the behavior management  and so on.   THAT IS RIDICULOUS  UNFAIR AND UNNECESSARY  Just like a group planning a party  your group should split ALL of the jobs before  during and after the game.    And you can switch your style  even in traditional games like DnD  to one with more (or total) shared narrative control.  Then  it's a collaborative session and you are no more ""responsible"" for the success of the session than anyone else.  In fact  there are even GM-less games or games where the GM role rotates from scene to scene or session to session.  There's a whole wide world of awesome systems and play styles that don't have the ad budget that DnD has. Give them a try - even if you don't completely adopt them there tips & tricks that you will be exposed to that could improve your game.  If all your players do is show up with a piece of paper & pencil and wait for you to provide 4 hours of fantastic entertainment  then you shouldn't put so much pressure on yourself.  That's like you trying to coordinate a picnic with 6 friends but all they do is show up with an empty stomach.   You should absolutely NOT be the one walking away from that feeling like the impostor."
692,Two of my favorite games: HERO System  The Dark Eye. The first is an amazing generic game where everything you could imagine you can do with a flexible point buy system  the other one is a really logical system with the most engaging and immersive world I've encountered (it hit home with me  that kind of fantasy).
693,I’ve seen lots of underglow where I live  except it’s the bad kind. People buy the cheap LED strips off of Amazon and it doesn’t create the nice  consistent glow of neon underglow. There’s spots where you can clearly tell a bulb is. Underglow  like all car mods  I guess  look better when tastefully executed.
694,They should have just delayed by another year. That way we could see thousands of posts  from people that can't handle that. No matter what  no game companies can win.  Not saying what they are doing is right btw. Just pointing out there is a no win scenario for them.
695,The only games I’m looking forward to are Cyberpunk 2077 and eventually The Zelda 64 remasters.  The medium is so contaminated with psychological manipulation it isn’t fun anymore.  I don’t enjoy my money being the actual endgame goal to every game.
696,Dont have very high hopes  but I'll just go for it. I recently got into app developing but I dont have the biggest budget  so I was hoping I would find someone that could give me tips on specs for a laptop or a desktop. Thanks in advance.
697,Hey fellow devs!   I have been seeing a lot of posts lately about the issues and bad practices towards employees in Game studios (mostly AAA). If you could talk to a company leader or enact change in how game creators are treated in a company what would you change and how?  This topic has been festering in my mind a lot lately and would love to hear your feedback and/or experiences. You all are doing incredible work and making the world a better place and I hope this can help us all get treated better in the future. Let's try not to make this about how shitty companies are but how they can be improved! Thank you all for the feedback!
698,Ran it on my 3700x just to see what it thought. It had me run 44/43.75 (ccx0/1) @ 1.275v and passed all of it's tests. 3 cores failed in 90 seconds of Small FFT's in Prime95. I binned the chip when I got it in March and it was only capable of 42 @ 1.3v all core  so I have taken the sage advice of just running stock with PBO enabled which results in single core boosts up to 4.4ghz and is Small FFT stable for hours.  This may be a decent way to see how high of a CB20 score you could get without crashing  but it does not seem to lead to a stable overclock. Neat idea though.
699,I recently drove on a mini vacation about an hour away from my home and on the way one of the bolts that holds my brake caliper in place came loose and the top end fell off  causing it to grind on the inner wheel. I’m not sure how this happened but I need to get a bolt replacement. I’m not entirely sure which one I need though. I know it’s a 17mm head for my front caliper. I believe the exact bolt I need is labeled as H803. Does anyone know if this will work?
700,   # Would like to get your Feedback on my current Game!  &#x200B   Hello  every one! Would like to get some feedback on my current game!   Roll  Down is a simple Racing Game where you control a small collection of  classic sport balls and have to participate in different event types  like Time Attack and Speed-trap. At the moment I am making the  transition from the Demo to the Early Access Version!  &#x200B   You can Download it here:[https://gamejolt.com/games/rolldown/506362](https://gamejolt.com/games/rolldown/506362)  What the Game All ready includes:  We  have already two game-modes (Time Attack and Speed-trap)  Three Sport  Balls which you can customize and Two maps one is represent the finished  Version and the other one will get an rework in the finale version!  Thank you for your Suport!
701,I was curious about this as well and did some research. My determination  which I [I wrote about here](https://unpossiblejourneys.com/what-explains-the-market-success-of-fifth-edition-dungeons-and-dragons/) is that it’s a combination of familiarity  marketing  and network effects.
702,"I wouldn't complain.  ( Half joking: Would I complain about a new sports simulation to name an extreme...? Maybe  *if* it is objectively worse than both the prequel and competition. )  So far I even played *sequels* that don't quite feel like the previous or at least first in the series anymore  thus there's a lot of space for innovation and experimentation.  Crysis/CoD feels a bit like Quake/Doom  Ori is a Metroidvania maybe (who cares  categorization helps me to explore and buy exactly those games that are ""all similar if you squint your game designer inner eye""  ) )  and Elex feels like Skyrim/Fallout 3  etc.  Still here narrative and world are new  character and mechanics may vary - like a new drawing/story/movie.  Here artists and storytellers don't have to explain why they paint just another person with oil on a canvas and tell stories that follow the Hero's Journey book/pattern. We copy images  songs  stories  etc. and make them our own or just do that for practice (not pure forgery and selling imitations).  I would say in games we are lucky in the sense that narrative  mechanics  interactions  art  etc. - since they are potentially also highly interactive - have far more possibilities than a movie to explore the game play space further in some sense (replayability  variations of games and DLC/mods  multiplayer  etc.).  Actually it is hard to develop a software for good emergent  procedural CGI movie  and still we are lucky that it is possible at least go a bit further in that emergent/procedural direction with games even for Indies."
703,Well. Here i am in a pickle. Ive owned my neon srt-4 for about 5 years now and it just rolled over 212 000 miles. Ive replaced things as needed and kept it going and it still runs fairly well but not how it used to. I am sitting here half heart broken because this was my realistic dream car in highschool and now its just slowly falling apart from age and use. Im a dad and first time home owner and its my only vehicle and i feel its time to walk away from the turbo 4 banger scene as an income/financial stand point. The cars been paid off for a while but its always one thing after another with both mine and the womans car. What do you all think?
704,I just discovered its existence in reading about Gerrymandering in RatFucked.  Seems like a solid software  but I'm wondering if it's actually a profitable skillset outside of drawing districts for legislatures/politicians.  Anybody have experience in an open source alternative?  There's training courses coming up in early October and I'm wondering if it would be worth it.
705,hey man  I think you play too much games then you can't think of other types of games or new ideas. lets try something completely different than computer and gaming  you will see new and original ideas. Cheer!
706,It's interesting  according to this CB data they could have had a 25% increase over the 2080ti with the 3080 (which is still a ~60% increase over 2080) at 270W.   That seems respectable enough to me  but they still went for 320W for a 30%/~75% increase instead.
707,I am a Psychology student from University of Toronto Scarborough looking for individuals to interview about motivation  life purpose and happiness. I am interested in hearing about how you found out your purpose in life  how you stayed motivated in pursing this purpose even through low point and how/why this bring happiness to you. If you are interesting send me a message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
708,"I rag on Cadillac/GM all the time but this time I must commend them on not producing a cost-cutting FWD sedan. The A-class is a decent car but it's interior and driving dynamics are not worth $50k. The 2GC is an absolute turd of a car but probably has the best interior quality here.   GM reskinned and improved the already fun-to-drive ATS. It's styled well enough and doesn't look like an economy car like the BMW. The interior is its achilles heel. Cadillac interiors aren't ""bad "" but they are visible a notch below the segment leaders."
709,My biggest problem is that I often want to have consequences  but bad ones. Much like a grimdark campaign  but lower scale.  Decide to leave a human alive? He’s the new BBEG.  Decide to leave an encounter because it’s OP? It’s destroyed a town.  Wanted to end a drug cartel? The drugs were holding back a bigger threat by trade.  That  AND constantly reminding my players of their issues. It got to the point that I have had my players just try to get the police to handle it instead.   I need to work on GOOD consequences so my players feel like their impacting the world for the better.
710,"Also the published numbers from the automaker can be different country to country (even if they use the same units). Each country can have different city and highway ""cycles"" that they test against for window sticker fuel economy numbers  so the numbers may be different. Just something to keep in mind when you see similar sized cars getting better or worse ratings for different markets!"
711,>Before even doing a linear regression I have to know wtf a “class” object is and how it works.  No you don't? You really don't need to know much about python to use numpy.polyfit  My education is in pure math  with no programming and very little stats. I tried to learn both at the same time with no prior programming experience and Python was much  much easier because the syntax was more intuitive by miles.  Edit: Really the only thing that seemed better about R is that ggplot2 is way better than matplot lib  but I don't do much data viz anyway.
712,"My golden D&D years were with AD&D 2d  so my irate responses come from there:  First  if you mean your argument to be just about 5E  be more explicit about it. If I'm running AD&D 2d *Dark Sun * the one where the setting book says ""these races and these weapons from the PHB and other supplements don't exist  and a couple of other allowed races and classes work differently than the PHB"" (see also: *Birthright*)  I don't see where you have the problem of supplement creep being an issue.   Second  *Planescape* can be run seriously  which means anything else can. If you can't make a group of random weirdos from all over existence fighting modrons or slaad serious  that's on you man  not the game. If the stakes are right  the consequences set  and the tone not veering into comedy ""because you can "" it can be serious business even if it's a cat-person  a robot  etc."
713,"Two episodes in and they are already resulting to constant still frames with the ""dynamic"" movement to the side of the screenshot.  If they can't bother to animate the literal point of the show  then it's just a waste of time."
714,"Since the 90's  Mercedes has never seemed to know what they are doing at any given time. They grew their lineup tremendously in the late 90's and early 2000's introducing terrible A/B-class models  they doubled down on them and just when they start to pick up they pull the plug?  The Daimler-Chrysler merger  nearly killed them. They used none of the efficiencies of the combined car company  the executives of Chrysler that were behind the success of late 80's/90's Chrysler  like Bob Lutz and Thomas Stallkamp were forced out. Probably because of German executive's arrogance  none of the Americans were ""Doktoringenieurs""  so what did they know? Daimler did loot Chrysler's cash reserves so I guess there is that  at least Daimler did not have the business savvy to reshuffle Jeep before they split from Chrysler in 2008. Mercedes from this era get a bad rep  people falsely assume that Chrysler engineers or bean counters had something to do with it  when no Chrysler engineers or accountants touched any Mercedes from that era.   In the current era I don't know what differentiates them from Audi or BMW. I heard from a Mercedes salesmen that they have a really hard time selling the line to consumers  the overlapping models confuse customers. One guy told me that he can't exactly explain the difference of a CLS53 AMG and a AMG GT4 53  besides the hatchback. Their electric models are going to look just like a budget American or Korean vehicle  with none of the classic Mercedes presence.   Meanwhile the W201  W123  and W124 models have become classics  with none of their models since raising to that level of prominence."
715,So what's the drama about this show? I saw that apparently the new version has lots of spoilers or something and people can't tell if it's a remake or?...?  It looks pretty interesting so I want to make sure I don't watch the new version and regret it. Ty!
716,To calculate LTV of a customer you'll first want to identify what sort of transaction data you have. In the case of insurance contracts  you're probably dealing with discrete contractual data. This is good! This makes it easier to calculate the LTV of a customer because we know when a customer is no longer a customer. Here we're making the assumption that if a customer chooses to not renew their contract in a following year they have lapsed and their lifetime is effectively over. Reengagement does happen  but for simplicity sake we assume once a customer chooses to not renew a contract they are gone for good. If reengagement is uncommon  lapsed customers can be brought back into the the customer pool as a new customer. If it is common for a customer to reengage after lapsing  you may want to reevaluate the type of transaction data you have. It may be more appropriate to model the LTV using a probabilistic model designed for non-contractual data (Pareto/NBD or BG/NBD for continuous data - meaning a customer can make a transaction at any time or BG/BB for discrete data - meaning a customer can only make a transaction at a specified time)  With this in mind  you can approach the LTV calculation in a couple different ways. First  since we know the lifetime of lapsed customers (assuming we have contractual  discrete transaction data)  we can treat the LTV calculation as a regression problem. Using the regression model of your choice you can predict the LTV of a new customer using covariates (demographics  prior web engagement  etc ) specific to that customer. If you choose to use a tree-based model or some other model that isn't easily explained  you can look into using SHAP (https://github.com/slundberg/shap for a Python implementation) to determine the impact a specific customer's covariates have on their LTV. The drawback of this method is you may potentially introduce survivorship bias since you would be training the model on customers who have lapsed. If you have enough data  this may not be a problem  but if your startup only has 2 years worth of data it may be worth thinking about projecting out LTV for your active customers.  Second  you could estimate LTV probabilistically by fitting a shifted Beta-Geometric distribution to model customer churn likelihood (https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Fader_hardie_jim_07.pdf). This type of model is a variant of a survival analysis. Instead of using a regression approach to fitting the survival curve  this model fits a distribution of churn rates to the customer population. Some more information about the fitted model parameters and their interpretation can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-customer-lifetime-values-using-a-shifted-beta-geometric-model-86bf538444f4 You'll probably also want to consider incorporating covariates into the model. This gets a little scary mathematically  but you can use some of the calculations here to help you get started http
717,I think my biggest flaw is **self-doubt** in my abilities as a Keeper in Monster of the Week. I will second guess myself throughout the whole mystery and think that all my players are having a bad time. I embarrassingly  during my first attempt at a campaign  asked after every session if everyone had fun and give me suggestions if I did something wrong.   We just ran a session last week that kicked off a new MotW campaign and I tried to not second guess myself  only happened once or twice when the monster almost killed two of the pcs and did not ask for any feedback. I will take that as a sign of improvement lol.
718,Take a look at RISUS  The Anything RPG  and the Ring of Thieves solo adventure to get an idea of RPGing.  After that  if you want to run something for your friends  take a look at Toast of the Town module. (Don't read if you want to play it!)  All of these you can find for free at DriveThruRPG.  This is for reading. If what you want is to play  as long as you have people willing to play with you you don't really need to know all the rules from the get go. Newbies get a pass  and you'll learn by doing.
719,People who are experts/experienced in a field will often be the first to tell you they dont know enough to make a definitive statement. Whereas the average person will spew bs and declare it as the god given truth.
720,It is really sad not too many companies train people to be supervisors.  Moving from fighting demons in numbers to handling difficult people is not an easy transition.  It takes real skills.   The good news is  the transition from supervising several people to supervising several people who supervise several people is not too bad. But then you have to deal with internal politics  and budget.
721,I am needing a bit of a sanity check about this.  Unisystem (AFMBE) is known as being a gritty/realistic system to play in  which usually just means it's a lethal ruleset for the PCs. In contrast  my problem is that a lot of the tasks the PCs are trying to accomplish almost seem too easy when using the suggested target number of 9.  This is because most tests - say  climbing a wall - involve a D10 roll plus your character's relevant Attribute (Dexterity or Strength) \*and\* their Skill in the task (Climbing). This is before any additional modifiers from any Qualities they may have. So as a GM  I feel like my players haven't even leveled up yet but they're already in a lot of positions where they only fail on a roll of 2 or even 1.  I of course could just add more difficulty modifiers  but the rules as written suggest only very light modifiers  with none at all for most combat situations. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this experience - is 9 just too low of a target number for most tasks in All Flesh Must Be Eaten?  I've only been using this system for five sessions so I'm definitely still feeling it out. I guess the relative ease of completing simple tasks does help keep the story moving and lend to the feeling that these are extraordinary characters we're following around.
722,I saw two in the same day a couple of weeks ago. One first gen Chrysler Neon and one SRT-4 racing a Panamera e-Hybrid on a freeway. Both looked like they were in good contition. Especially weird since I live in Iceland

724,Sorry to hear about this man. Similar story with me when I was working at Disney. That level of depression was affecting me physically. Even after quitting it took me a long time to recover. Hope you're okay <3
725,It's called BATMAN ROLE-PLAYING GAME  basically you make a hero of Gotham and beat up bad guys. Problem is I cant Google it as all that comes up is how to make batman it DND and NSFW stuff  can anyone help it's kinda complicated and I dont have the time to read it cover to cover
726,It's possible the industry takes another stab at 450mm wafer production  which would result in a 20-30 percent cost reduction. You have to more or less build a completely new suite of machinery  and the investment involved would be very high
727,Godot Engine has its own scripting language called GDScript.  It is very easy to read  write and understand.  GDScript is heavily influenced by Python  which is one of the most intuitive programming languages in the world.  I would absolutely recommend it to a beginner over C#  C++ or similar languages. It is much easier.  [https://godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org)  /r/godot
728,I recommend that you watch Jia Jiang's 100 days of rejection therapy on YT. And please consider taking the time to understand why this makes you feel bad. Yes  rejection hurts. I went through a lot and it made me stuck for months. Then  I watched a video on limiting beliefs. The real reason that I hated rejection was because of the rejection from my father.   I can handle rejection better right now. I don't care if they ignore me. It's not my loss.
729,"I don't know about a ""replacement"" for D&D  but **Ironsworn** and **Ryuutama** are my top two fantasy rpgs and will scratch different itches. (I'm not sure if either would scratch the strategic combat system itch  though.) I also like **Forbidden Lands**  though I haven't had the opportunity to play yet.  **Ironsworn** is an easy rec because the pdf is free! So you can go download it now and see what you think. The game is designed to function without a GM (though you can and many have certainly used one) - so if no one wants to GM or someone wants to learn to GM and isn't confident  you can pull this game off the shelf and get going. Ironsworn revolves around the vows the characters make - you earn XP by completing them  so the story is always fairly tight because you're never really wandering around wondering what your characters should be doing. Since the game is fiction-first  combat is more theatre of the mind than grid system.  Hit up Youtube to see it in action - the High Rollers did a pretty great co-op oneshot. Me  Myself  and Die has started season two using Ironsworn and as of this post there are two episodes (episode two uses minis for the combat to illustrate what's happening).  **Ryuutama** is a fantasy trpg designed from the ground up to be for newbies - that goes not just for the players  but has one of the best ""how to be a GM"" guides I've seen in the form of giving the GM a character that works differently from the PCs. This character codifies the GM's abilities and teaches them how to use different GM techniques. I say it was designed for newbies - but that doesn't make it a game that is only for newbies. You just have to be into the vibe of Ryuutama - a warm and cozy style trpg  which may make it a trpg that people who wouldn't get into D&D more interested. My group loved it for the sort of ""weekend wind down"" feel.   **Forbidden Lands** is much closer to D&D than my other two recs. It has an old-school feel with some interesting takes on the genre. I was drawn to it for the focus on exploration and base-building. Since I haven't played it and haven't even watched some actual plays yet  I'm not going to be the best one to sell it  though! (Heck - I'm starving  so I doubt I've properly sold Ironsworn or Ryuutama either.)  Whatever you end up picking up  I hope you enjoy them!"
730,if the formula for mainline Love Live series is like a family bucket of Kotori Fried Chicken  think about Nijigasaki as individual platters of KasuKasu's - full of things that make individual idols shine in their own way. We've already rejected the idea that harmony and working together alone will make a successful school idol club - Kasumi and totally not a school idol Nakagawa Nana already clash on their ideals of school idol-ing. That Kasumi figures it out is going to be indicative of a style more reminiscent of iDOLM@STER  where individual character arcs are going to loosely tie in together rather than trying to make everything mesh together immediately.
731,Horror in RPGs is the most difficult to do  since it's usually a collection of guys with bags of chips and soda drinks dicking around at a table. So don't beat yourself up if you don't pull it off  especially if you're starting out as a GM.   Offer them a fun experience  with some marines cleaning out a hive  and maybe throw in a twist or two. As for improv and dialogue  that's there you come in. Read the scenario well  make a note of the main events  and reproduce it from memory. Don't bother with dialogue charts and other crap  that will only slow you down and turn away focus from the game. Improvisation improvement comes with play and experience.    Try to place yourself in the shoes of the NPCs as you talk. Are they trying to survive? Is their motivation greed? Are they a gruff combat veteran marine sergeant or a squirmy computer nerd? Don't be afraid to use common tropes  even if you exaggerate a little. That's why they are tropes  because they work.  As for improv  it's all about knowing the environment. Try to think of what else would happen on the station/ship while players are exploring it. Is another group of survivors trying to overload the reactor? Is the AI mass fabricating robots to deal with the infestation? Has Weyland-Yutani sent out another crew to retrieve a specimen? Are the aliens chewing through the gravity stabilizers while building their hive? All of these can lead to interesting events  which you can fall back on in case you need to when the players decide they don't want to follow the script.  And as a last resort for improv  have a bunch of guys with pulse rifles burst into the room. While they players deal with the situation  you can figure out your next move  and where the attackers came from.  When it comes to descriptions  again  refer to the environment. Is it the loading dock? Describe vast halls with cranes  chains  and rusted haul ships. Is it the android bay? Describe an assembly line with robotic arms welding on parts to frameworks  and defective robots stumbling about. Medical center? Slick white sterile beds and embryonic fluid recovery tanks. Ore Refinery? Claustrophobic pipes and compressors  intense heat  steam hissing. Power center? Massive turbines thundering with each refresh  launching sparks up cables.  Consume as many reference  comics  movies  comics  and video games related to the genre as possible  then try to put into words what you see to get better as descriptions. Books in the genre help massively if you have the time.  Also  take a look at the free [Mothership RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245017/Mothership-Players-Survival-Guide). Should have some random tables that might help with stuff.
732,This is like saying biology is obsolete because we have automated pipetting robots.  Science is about the questions we're asking  not the manual labor of running the experiments. The more we can automate away  the faster  easier  and more reproducibly we can pursue answers to those questions. Data scientists will always have a role  because there will always be questions to interrogate data for.  Of course  data scientists who only know the algorithms and have no domain knowledge will struggle  but that's already the wrong balance of skills.
733,"They got caught red handed. Their own subsidiary  under their own management and ownership  doesn't get these cards unless orders come down from MSI.    It's like how Amazon is ultimately responsible for everything Whole Foods does. Amazon owns Whole Foods  therefore all decisions taken by Whole Foods are taken by Amazon.    Don't let MSI's ""swift actions/statements"" fool you. They knew it was only a matter of time before they were caught  and were prepared for this. At minimum  we must hold them accountable for failure to adequately oversee their own operations. At most  they're filthy fuckin liars."
734,Capitalism tends to indicate everything will converge and we end up with mono-system culture.  'We went with X because it has the most reach' times infinity - they went with a system that probably isn't going to produce the best experience because... existing other-IP fanbase knows how to use it.
735,Competition is fiercer today than it was in the 80’s and 90’s  to address your E30 comment.  Lexus is resting on their laurels  when they easily could have designed an entirely new generation of IS. Sure  numbers on a piece of paper isn’t the end all  be all of what defines a good car or a bad car. But the car  which deserved a thorough redesign  isn’t helping its own cause when its competition has gotten better in many categories.  I  for one  think the new IS looks great. But it needs more updates than what Lexus has given it. It’s not a “bad” car in its own right. But in terms of specs  the Germans (namely BMW) seem to have it beat in many categories.  For myself  I would’ve liked to have seen:  A longer IS with more room inside.  An updated version of the current 3.5 V6 that puts out more hp and torque  all the while being more fuel efficient.  A more updated interior design that doesn’t look 99% the same as the previous gen.  Everything else about it is totally fine.
736,It’s too soon. Unless they’ve been working on it in secret at the very least since Andromeda  it’s not going to be anything that people want.   Not to mention the amount of people listing things for a remake while saying they want a remaster. Conflating the terms. People are going to be so disappointed when it’s only a few texture changes. Things that can already be accomplished with mods.   Remasters are such a waste of money. If you’re going to put in the work  do it right and work on a remake  BioWare.
737,I was looking forward to ikebukuro west gate park because of the original  but man  this was trash  maybe the worse doga koba anime Ive ever watched.  Maojou de oyasumi was pretty solid  it was funny  light  the music I liked  the direction was good too  like shot composition  etc.   One room third season  I actually liked a lot  pretty good direction this really surprised me  and the character seems good  and the other characters are the others seen in the others seasons  so probably I will like a lot more than the other seasons.  Kuma kuma kuma bear  I almost dropped under 1 minute  this fanservice really angered me  but the rest was mediocre  not that bad  but I was expecting more.  Tonikaku kawaii  ehh  okay  kinda funny  but nothing really more than that.  And Adachi to shimamura  it was the one I was most anxious for  unfortunately didnt looked pretty good  but its the only yuri so I will watch probably until the end  I kinda like it but idk  I need to watch the rest to know  this episode didnt really introduced the characters really well I think  we can see what the characters kinda feel towards each other  but not really their personality.
738,I love my job and my industry. I've also worked with plenty of intelligent  driven  and capable people that feel the same. And plenty more that burned out and moved to other tech industries or whole fields altogether. No two people are the same  and likewise no two experiences are either.  In general  if you can get hired in the game industry  you could get hired doing the same type of work outside of games for somewhat more money and shorter hours. Plenty of people are passionate about games  but fewer are passionate about *making* them. It's like the difference between cooking and eating. A lot of people love going to a nice restaurant  but not everyone wants to be working in the kitchen.   You should try learning some on your own to see how you feel. I certainly wouldn't recommend getting a second Bachelor's. A Master's may or may not have value for you. But if what you want to do is  say  be a programmer than if you want to learn to program better on your own and build a portfolio of game projects  that's what you need to apply. You can do that while still working your day job rather than getting deep into debt. You definitely don't want to go back to school for years before you realize you don't like this either!  I will say though  don't expect it to make everything better. A job is still a job  and games can be even less rewarding depending on the kind of validation you like. I like making games played by millions of people  and I'm not the sort of person bothered by internet comments. If you are  games can be a really draining experience. You spend years working on a huge project and all you see online are people hating on it.
739,Is it recommended? Not really. Will it do the job? Yes. Unity and Unreal will run just fine the challenge is going to be programs like Maya or Substance if you choose to go the 3D route.   Depending on what you want to accomplish  and what programming language you know Unity will be fine. It has great documentation and an abundance of tutorials on YouTube. I have a bias for Unreal because of my job and honestly both are free to download so I recommend just getting your feet wet and messing around with both. Find what works for you personally

741,"The logical follow up questions would be:  ""Which games that you've tested don't work?"" and ""When do you expect to publish a list of compatible games?"""
742,This is what I imagined when I discussed raytracing as the future of video games. Having a downright stupid amount of direct lights drastically expands the possible lighting a game can have. Imagine an RTS where each individual unit can have it's own light source.
743,Nice looking car  nice interior  and nice powertrain. But overall NOT nice enough in any one area for the price  especially in light of it's horrendous depreciation.   It looks good but not $100k good  the interior is good but not any nicer than a loaded BMW X5  and aside from straight-line performance it is too numb and floaty to drive.
744,To add to what other people have already said  these brands don't have RWD SUVs in their mainstream brands to share components/costs with. Even if they have a RWD sedan platform  it would take a lot of development and cost to make that platform work for an SUV. For example  all of the Chevy CUVs/SUVs are FWD so the Cadillacs on the same platforms are FWD. The only reason the Lincoln Aviator is RWD is because the Ford Explorer is RWD now. Even the BMW X1 is FWD because it uses the same platform as Mini.
745,   Hey guys  currently I had just graduated and I basically got 3 months of freetime that I really want to make any use of  however due to the fact that I have obligatory military training I can't be job hunting at the moment but I still would like to learn some new things  now for myself I have been using stuff like Sklearn  pandas and Numpy very comfortably now  -not so comfortable yet with TF and PyTorch- and I am not really in mood to do another Coursera course -Already did the DL Andrew Specialization and one of his NLP courses aswell as some Data Engineering courses- now I want to try something new what do you recommend I'd do during this time? I have thought about polishing my Frontend skills  but I am not really keen on Frontend if I am being honest so I would love to hear you guys' suggestions! Thanks!
746,I've seen a lot of old fans try to convince newcomers to not watch the new anime because it's not a remake  but more like a sequel-ish retelling that differs from the original Visual Novel and the Deen anime adaptation. They frequently tell people that might want to watch the new anime to watch the original instead  so as not to get spoiled.  However  these old fans need to realise that all they are doing is turn people away from this amazing franchise  because many of those newcomers who will now reconsider what to do will not want to go back and watch 50 episodes of the Deen anime  nor will they start reading an 80 hour long Visual Novel of something they don't even know. At least not if they aren't already fans of the Visual Novel medium.  Ryukishi  the creator of the series who also wrote the new anime  specifically said that newcomers can enjoy this new show without any problems. Just because it reveals certain things earlier than the old Higurashi  doesn't mean that it ruins the mystery or anything. In fact  it may make things even more confusing and interesting for some new viewers.  It's like playing Umineko before Higurashi. Would I recommend it? No. You should always start a series chronologically  if at all possible. But if someone who hasn't played the Higurashi VN wants to start with Umineko  then that's fine too even if Umineko spoils a few things about Higurashi. It's exactly the same with the new Higurashi anime.  Ideally  you should watch the original anime first or start with the VN  if you really want to get into the When They Cry franchise. However  you don't **have to** do that. It's not some kind of mistake to watch this new show  even if you don't know anything about it. There will be more than enough mysteries for you to solve!
747,There’s lots of cars that disappear- think about how you still see old preludes or camrys and accords - where are the cars that are newer ? They sold a shitload of neons/cobalts/Chrysler 300s/escorts/g6.... yeah some are 15+ yrs old   but the 300s were very popular and everywhere and in like 10 yrs - gone
748,DLSS is to be compared with other upscaling methods for a fair evaluation. Temporal upsampling is already a much more widespread one and it brings a good performance improvement too  without needing special hardware. It seems that it's not as good as DLSS but I don't know of any objective comparison between them to be honest. Anyway  that reduce the performance advantage of DLSS quite a bit and if it ends up only supported by a couple of titles  it may very well turn into another dead technology from NVIDIA.
749,>IPC improvements of Willow Cove are quite mixed. In some rare workloads  which can fully take advantage of the cache increases we’re seeing 9-10%  improvements  but these are more of an exception rather than the rule.  In other workloads we saw some quite odd performance regressions   especially in tests with high memory pressure where the design saw  \~5-12% regressions. **As a geometric mean across all the SPEC workloads  and normalised for frequency  Tiger Lake showed 97% of the performance  per clock of Ice Lake**.   3% regression in IPC?
750,Thanks everyone for the suggestions.   There are some cool ideas here. I’ve got a lot to consider.  I’ve never taken a look at Cthulhu Dark before so that’s really plus.   And own a giant Jenna tower already so that is a cool cause I completely forgot about Dread.  This will be easy.  Thanks again.
751,Awe yeah I mean  don't want to call attention to a horrible atrocity you committed. The best way to not call attention to it is to make a fuss and have it removed from everything in a way most people will notice. Good call  genius move.
752,The 4.6L v8 that Ford makes is a great engine. It makes like 230 uncharged. Also probably not that expensive  plus the motors have a lot of life in them considering many make it over 300k. I believe you can get them close to 300 horses with some minor tweaking.
753,I've been driving my F-Type in the LA area for about two years now and only one person has ever walked up to me at a gas station and asked about the car and he was just a fellow car enthusiast. Other than that  no one's tried racing me and I get occasional glances. Certainly doesn't feel like I'm drawing attention.YMMV?
754,"I'm researching an idea for a future game  and the only titles that spring to mind are ""fake"" escort missions like Bioshock Infinite  Last of Us and God of War. They don't count because your guide/escort is invulnerable.  Any ideas/feedback appreciated! Thanks."
755,"With 1 being ""Why even ask this question? Obviously not"" and 10 being ""You can't do without it.""  &#x200B   Sorry if this is a dumb question but there isn't a dedicated question thread in this subreddit."
756,The microarch is optimised for the ISA it is designed to run.    The implemented features have been selected to match the target ISA  and the execution units are balanced based on typical code for that ISA.   Slapping a new front end on for a new ISA without changing the rest of the microarch will probably possible. But you will either end up with instructions that can't be implemented efficiently (falling back to microcode) or you will end up with microarch features which are now unneeded and wasting transistors  power or even performance.   Chances are it will be both.
757,Not really. Reducing the technical barrier of entry makes it easier to build models  which means more models get built  but for the high value  or regulatory  stuff you're still (probably) better off building it from scratch. So you know very specifically what is happening under the hood and have much finer control over things like explainabiltiy  feature importance  overfitting  etc.  &#x200B   Also  being a good data scientist isnt really about writing code  tbh  it's about having the appropriate scientific approach and cynism to prove and disprove ideas.  &#x200B   I'd argue its no different to  say  the idea that trifacta would mean data engineers no longer write code. How wrong that idea was!
758,This is the first game I have bought on launch in years. I played the demo back in the steam summer game festival and I knew it would be an instant buy from me. The hit of nostalgia I get from playing this is unmatched. Even without the nostalgia factor  it is just a well made game and the concepts are timeless. I truly hope that they remake the sequel and expand the franchise.

760,This will be very close to 3070 performance  82% of the cuda and the same bandwidth  less starved even. 10-15% slower at $399 seems like a good deal. This also probably means 3060 is ga106 and 192bit 6GB  leaving us lower end users at 6GB and down  wich sucks

762,Everyone is talking 1/4 mile times  I feel like MPH is much more important. My Mustang I would consider to be fast for a street car. It does 113mph in the 1/4 mile. I can keep up with entry level high end sports cars (Audi R8  NA Porsche 911s etc) in a straight line.   Cars that run 125mph+ are extremely fast. I've driven 2 cars that are capable of running those sort of mph and that's when things start to get scary fast.   I feel like cars that run 105-110mph in the 1/4 is about the limit for the street.  110-115mph is manageable but a touch too fast. When I go backroads carving the amount of speed I can pickup from apex to corner exit is like jail territory.

764,Auto notification doesn’t work. I almost never get the emails when things come back in stock. I never got any emails from any of the retailers I subscribed with for the 3080 launch. But the few times I do get them  they’re always late and have already sold out again.
765,"I'm reading dungeon world now  just arrived this morning in the post. I was reading Mutant: Year Zero earlier  but the who ""civilization destroyed by a huge plague"" was hitting too close to home  and besides  none of my players wanted to do post-apoc anyway.  Personally I find the ""classic fantasy"" of dungeon world pretty dull  but I like the irreverent tone its written in  and my players love classic fantasy and are slightly bitter that I've straight up admitted I'll never run D&D  ever."
766,In-character dialogue.   I think I'm pretty good at setting up scenarios  challenges and conflicts  and playing things out according to the players' actions. I also don't have any trouble describing the on-screen action  environment  or NPCs. I can keep things moving  and feeling cinematic.   But I'm not the most natural at speaking at-length in character. Sometimes I'll get into the groove  but often I'll fall back to describing or glossing over the details of the conversation  and sprinking some in-character lines in there for flavour. That's more in my comfort zone  but I'd prefer not to do this quite so often.
767,“OpenGL® and older versions of DirectX® provide a very simple model to drive GPUs. These APIs are easy to understand and are very suitable for learning purposes. They rely on the driver to do a lot of work which is hidden from the developer. Consequently  it can be very hard to optimize a full-featured 3D engine.  On the opposite side  the PlayStation® 4 API is very light and very close to the hardware.  Vulkan® is somewhere in the middle. There is still an abstraction because it runs on different GPUs  but we have much more control. For instance  we are responsible for handling memory or implementing a shader cache. As the driver has less work to do  we have more work to do! However  coming from the PlayStation®  we were more comfortable with controlling everything.”  Interesting that for all of Vulkan’s improvements  it’s still the middle ground when compared to console APIs.
768,>Porsche is basically seen as the holy grail of enthusiast cars  Its because if you are going to spend money on a car  spend it on something that is built for sport  rather than adapted for it.   Overall  its still a german car. No matter what anyone tells you  German cars are not reliable when you compare anything that comes out of Japan.  Germans do engineering differently. They basically pick technoligies that sound good on paper and implement them in the vehicles without thinking about longevity or implications  and then they let someone else handle the manufacturing solutions to match what they designed. Japanese  on the other hand consider the whole car  and manufactuing processes are second to none as they can reliably reproduce accurate dimentions for every part.
769,It's nice that they ditched the 4GB RAM base model  but the dual-core i3 is still unfortunate. And obviously it would be nice to have Ryzen here  but Tiger Lake gets pretty close and you get Thunderbolt 4.  It looks like last year's model had an upgradable SSD with soldered Wi-Fi and RAM. This one looks to use the same chassis  so I assume that wouldn't change?
770,I own a 2003 Honda Accord EX(automatic) and I just had to get the lock cylinder replaced(I believe one of the wafers seized  and I could have replaced the ignition switch myself and saved money). They gave me new keys  and I noticed the key looked very similar to my old key. I Checked and they are slightly different  but I was wondering what the chances of me getting a key with the exact same pattern were.

772,The first gen Audi TT. Its simple design and the materials hold up really well. It also has a turbo I4 engine  like every other car on the road today.  I didn't like the TT when it was new  but it has grown on me over the years and now I love it.

774,Aluminum racing 1.5 pump jack is the best thing to get. It's light and can be carried with one hand. It's so light I just keep in in the car along with a tool box with a heavy duty air pump  heavy duty tire plug tools razor knife to cut excess plug material  pliers and screw drivers for pulling nails and screws  tire pressure gauge  plenty of extra tire plugs and a wheel chock.
775,"I saw people already scared in the 12 episodes announcement  but the pacing confirmed it: This series is gonna be rushed. Like a lot. The neck-breaking fast pace took us from ""lol who are you"" to the main character confessing his love for his childhood girlfriend.       So far it is okay I guess. Hina is a fun character but I can see her getting on peoples nerves tho (not me yet). For an anime about the end of the world it is quite humerous  which I have mixed feelings about. We'll just have to see where this will go."

778,I personally found it somewhat dull. Unless the idea of exploration really gets you going  it might not grip you. As the two characters the show revolves around aren't really that interesting in my opinion. Obviously  this is just my perspective though. It's always good to just try it if you think you would like it and make up your own mind.
779,I'm currently getting flamed by my mum for me constantly hitting this protector under my kia. However i've been told by many people that the protectors are designed to be bashed around. When i'm coming out of a driveway or down a steep hill it's almost impossible to not hit this thing. So  am i rightfully getting flamed here or are these protectors meant to be love tapping the ground. Cheers.
780,Hi! I am a Physics PhD student looking for jobs in DS. I have experience in statistics  regression and coding in Python as well as C++. I have been looking for opportunities recently but never received any interview calls. I am wondering if there are roles in the industry that looking for people in my background. And are there any specific skills I should develop.
781,I ordered the MSI on launch day  within a second of release  but it’s on back-order. Is there any good reason to drop this reservation and go to the back of the line on a TUF  when all I really care about is stock performance and lowest noise?  I feel like people are making these cards out to be really different  but the numbers show such minuscule differences and even then almost only when pressed even harder than normal.   I have nothing for MSI especially  I know their software is crap... but I don’t really use any of it (except afterburner). So my takeaway is basically that it’s a good enough card that is exceptionally quiet and will perform better than FE *and* many other AIBs. Is that about right?
782,"But look at rtx 3090 strix product page on Best Buy  it shows an image with 6 of the ""bad"" ones.  Asus used to show this same image  now they show the new one.  Willing to bet they discovered this issue and then went back to dwg board and are not caring about hitting a release window  and rather care about getting it right."
783,I have a 97' Dodge Ram 1500 with 171 000 miles  it's a V8 5.2L I believe  that I inherited from my Dad (daily driver since 97') and on the highway it takes alot to get to 80mph (with O/D on if that makes a difference  I do alot of highway driving for work). The tachometer never reads any higher than 2500rpms even under full throttle  which I thought was odd because it reads much higher than that. Also it's extremely quiet when idling  like to the point that I've gotten out of it in a rush not realizing it's still running... Even an AAA guy said it was quiet as hell lol. Is it possible I have an exhaust problem? I get that it's more of a work truck but it just seems to be running slower and quieter than it should. If not is there anything else I could look at  there isn't much else that's noticably wrong with it other than a noisy steering pump (maybe some other squeaks and creaks but no leakage  overheating  or smoke). Kinda freaking out because I love it to death and an expensive ass exhaust repair might mean it's time for it to head to the junk yard soon so any suggestions would be much appreciated :(

785,The writing was on the wall when Samsung decided to start gearing up to manufacture OLED TV's.  edit: no  Samsung is not making an LCD/OLED hybrid. That would be the dumbest thing possible. You would have the motion  viewing angle  and uniformity issues of LCD  the burn-in issues of OLED   lower light-output than OLED  and it would be more expensive than both.  Samsung's panels are using blue OLED sub-pixels with a red and green QD filter for the red/green sub-pixels (or at least that was the original plan  i think they were having issues with blue light-leakage and might be using a regular RGB filter anyway). They are similar to LG's OLED's in that they use one sub-pixel color combined with a color filter.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that Samsung is making an OLED backlit LCD  or that anyone would ever make something that stupid.
786,Looks promising. The 3000 series was a great value proposition but this 5000 series looks great. I'd prefer that they include a cooler with the price hike  but likely they see high end CPU buyers get their own coolers instead. Which probably explains why only the 5600X has one.
787,Having read through the Quest RPG I'd say it's an interesting game  but I don't know that it's as good for beginners as it claims to be.  So much of Quest's mechanics are about the creation of dramatic storytelling in a mechanically significant way  and often these moments play out like an improv theater exercise or creative writing prompt.  That's fine  but it's a rather specific playstyle and may work well with certain types of players  but not others - especially not those who are coming in with expectations from CRPGs or 5E D&D.  It also demands a sort of comfort with genre and RPG tropes that might not be accessible to some beginners.  Finally an extremely simplistic universal resolution mechanic seems like it'd get old -- I'm not sure Quest is well built for campaign?  Likewise it puts a lot of demands to manage the table and player spotlight ( and to improv and spontaneously world build) on the GM which might be difficult for a newer GM.  Again  an interesting game  perhaps the birth of a new genre of RPGs for performative play (i.e. streamed play) but not exactly a beginner's game by my estimation at least?
788,There will be separate Battle Passes for each character. Free Battle Pass will be available for everyone up to level 40  but the paid Battle Pass will cost 1 000 Credits(equal to $10 USD). ~~You can only unlock Credits by purchasing them with real money~~. So it seems there will be microtransactions as well as a paid Battle Pass for each character post launch in a full priced game. I already lost interest after the open beta crashed my PS4 a multitude of times  but this is the nail in the coffin for me. You can argue that these are merely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay  but their intent is clear and it just does not sit right with me. Especially considering a large portion of players will be children. What the hell has this industry become?  edit: the paid Battle Pass is optional and you can eventually earn the Credits through grinding out the Battle Pass like Fortnite  but that still does not excuse this practice. Paid microtransactions and a cosmetic marketplace do not belong in a full priced game period.
789,Seems like Marques didn't understand the concept of DLSS when he was testing control  as he was trying to push native rendering to 8k - But  still fun to see what a casual gamer would do with a ~$35k gaming rig :D
790,So  I’ve recently accepted an offer at a great company. Pay is good  great benefits  an all around good corporate job (not FANG). But  compared to the interviews at start ups I’ve done (which pay way less and ask for way more) it doesn’t seem as technically advanced. How would one get exposure to the new technologies and techniques that start-ups utilize while working at a more cushion-e job? I’m basically trying to get the best of both worlds  the experience of a start up with the pay of an established company.  edit:   Hey guys   I just wanted to say thank you to all the great responses in this thread. I really appreciate hearing about other's experiences. Can't get enough of the DS community <3.
791,It's hard to give a specific answer to what is a very general question which depends heavily on the sort of data science job you mean  since they do vary massively from job to job. It would be a little easier to answer this if it was in comparison to another job.
792,"Honestly  its easier to teach a software engineer math than a mathematician swe skills.  A SWE will likely have a CS degree  which is a subset of mathematics that focuses on computation. A SWE with a CS degree will have the mathematical education on the mechanics of PCA  and basic graduate statistics. However they also have the technological exposure & programming skillset.  The stronger computational data scientists are able to actually deliver better value in their jobs because they grasp the tech stack from end to end  and can also implement the ML & mathematics required. Where they lack knowledge  it only comes in the form of lacking exposure to many different niches of statistics & ML. It only takes a stats guy to say ""Oh a good metric for your goal would be a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test"" - after this one sentence  the computational/programmer DS will be back in the more favourable position in actually putting that advice into practice."
793,The DATA step is a much easier and straightforward way to do observation (“training example”) level feature engineering than the vector based ways in Python and R. Python is great for general machine learning  not so great for traditional stats.   Honestly I can write like a compact 10 line program in SAS to do frequencies  distributions  rollups  AND a couple regressions complete with ANOVA tables and confidence intervals. It takes significantly more verbose code to do the same in Python.   I love Python a lot and R a bit but neither one holds a candle to SAS for code brevity if you really know what you are doing.
794,Running the big Traveller campaign Pirates of Drinax  but with Burning Empires as the system. It’s been on my mind for years now. I MAY get the chance in a few months (depending on what is happening with the virus of course...).
795,There's no reason to do this since independent reviews will be out soon anyway. If anything then it could just be a simple miscommunication within the marketing and QA team.  Cheating like this is a recipe for being caught and ridicule  it serves no gain for NV to self-sabotage.
796,"TL DR: Try both for a day or two and pick whichever one you vibe more with  I find that Unity is a bit of a clusterfuck when it comes to versioning  HDRP/LWRP/URP/BIRP  GameObjects vs DOTS ECS  etcetera  whereas with Godot you just have 3.2 stable and 4.0 master. Documentation for unity is spread across a whole bunch of sources  whereas Godot's docs are on readthedocs all in one place. Godot actually uses pixel measurements in 2d and not just the 3d coordinates.   At the same time  Unity is a quality engine with a lot of professionally made games published. They've just IPO'ed I think  so that's probably going to help cement them as industry standard. Essentially  I view it in a similar vein to Maya vs Blender  or ProTools vs Reaper.  I like to come to an old quote by the C++ guy  Bjarne Stroustroup. [There's the ones people complain about  and the ones nobody uses](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/ca/6d/bbca6da54df662c95fa1a5f01229cbff.jpg). So just because Unity has a lot of negatives doesn't mean it's necessarily ""bad""  and I don't want anyone to think I'm slagging either engine off."
797,Will the ps4 games have better performance on the ps5? Like run on a higher resolution and frame rate.
798,Hmm  I have to wonder just what Odin means by the end of the world. I know it's probably the actual end of the world  but somehow it feels like that could end up being more metaphorical  like a sea-change from which there is no return. Just a feeling based on how vague it all seems right now.  Really looking forward to how the story unfolds. Sucks that Yota's world has basically already ended though.
799,Since she already knows the outcome of everything maybe she already went through all of this. This is kinda stupid but what if this is just like a visual novel and the reason she knows everything is because she went through all the routes.
800,Hello guys  this is mac and I want some help if you guys  have answers please comment on my post or dm me...  The problem is.. today I was playing game for an hour and suddenly my PC's power off. I smell like something burning from power supply I check electric board and stabilizer it's all okay with them and then I smell the SMPS fans.. so the I thought due to high temperature it might be smelling... but after a while again I start my pc and didnt start I sees the smps fan was not working.. so I'm confused even scared that burned smps can also damage to my motherboard (processor graphic card ram etc..) or it just a normal problem even in my area electricity cutted out for (4-5 minute) twice.. so I'm worried about my inside components...
801,It's a 90s to early 00s RPG at this point  but if you have any interest in running something on the hard sci-fi end of the spectrum  I heartily recommend Blue Planet.  The system itself is a bit mired in 90s simulationism  but the setting they compose is fantastic. A wonderful at humanity's first colony on a completely different world  the aquatic planet known as Posiden.
802,I don't know how true whole thing is and I hope we find out soon* but I find it interesting that [according to TechPowerUp photos Palit went with one array of those more expensive caps](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/palit-geforce-rtx-3080-gaming-pro-oc/3.html) for just $10 over MSRP ($710).      \*[edit: it's true](https://forums.evga.com/m/tm.aspx?m=3095238&p=1)
803,Higher horsepower cars will benefit from awd from 0-60 because they need more traction off the line to put the power down. Low power cars like a new Mazda 3 are actually slower 0-60 with AWD because it doesn’t have enough power to utilize the extra traction of AWD. Once you are moving FWD/RWD will be quicker then AWD because AWD is heavier and have more drivetrain loss.
804,It’s a terrible replacement for the F 440i. It looks like a massive step backwards in every way from the previous generation cars. It may be faster 0-60  but it looks terrible  from all angles  not just the gawdawful grille. .91 grip is pathetic for what this is. I scratch my head why anyone would waste their money on this car unless they can get one for an absolute bargain. BMW is terrible now.
805,Severe people have mentioned this  but network.  Technical skills can always be improved  but networking take time.  Join some communities on campus  they do not even need to be directly related to your major.  You never know who will get a job at a big company with a data science opening.

807,Pretty much I guess  this is the end of SLI.  >With the emergence of low level graphics APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan  game developers are able to implement SLI support natively within the game itself instead of relying upon a SLI driver profile. The expertise of the game developer within their own code allows them to achieve the best possible performance from multiple GPUs. As a result  NVIDIA will no longer be adding new SLI driver profiles on RTX 20 Series and earlier GPUs starting on January 1st  2021.  Instead  we will focus efforts on supporting developers to implement SLI natively inside the games.  We believe this will provide the best performance for SLI users.    Developers are not going to be supporting SLI and Crossfire natively. That's the big issue.   I hope that someday  a better native solution can be found that requires zero developer involvement. Maybe NVLink or Infinity Fabric might allow that.   Rumour has it that both AMD and Nvidia are working on 5nm chiplet GPUs. Maybe one option is to simply have a large chiplet assembly with many smaller dies. The top end GPUs could even have the best dies harvested too.
808,I like math  logic  problem solving  and I’m curious and like digging in to find answers. In high school (late 90s)  I was very good at math and learned some HTML and loved coding and had fun creating websites. When I started college  I planned to major in computer science but got very intimidated by my first coding class and felt that career path would be “boring.” I switched my major to Communication with the hope of a “glamorous” career in PR or at a magazine. Turns out there are also a lot of boring jobs in PR (and marketing)  so I was very uninspired by my career  until I wound up in a marketing analytics role  working under someone who had a masters in statistics and started teaching me R. It re-sparked my love of math and coding. I started exploring options for a more data and analytic career path  but I had so many skill gaps  so I started researching education options - certificates  bootcamps  masters programs  etc. A masters program seemed like it would open the most doors  plus it was the only option my employer would help pay for (had to be a degree program at an accredited school).  So I enrolled in an MS in DS program  I’m about halfway through. I left my marketing analytics job for a product analytics role at a tech company  and I’m on a combined analytics & data science team. I genuinely love my job  and my detour into communication & PR was actually really helpful because I’m better at communicating and presenting than many of my colleagues.
809,So  a friend says that he watched a documentary about D&D that included Gary Gygax's kids. The documentary talked about the crazy  spending TSR did and  my friend says  that included buying or building their own train!!!  Does anyone know if this is true and what documentary it's in?
810,I'm a first year undergrad and currently learning Java. Just wondering which game engine would suit me better as a person with no background with either C++ or C#. I'm looking to do small side projects as I found that it looks better in a resume/portfolio if I do include these things for future applications/interviews.   Also  are there any other game engines that support Java? I had a course that had us use Processing where we created a game of Pong  Breakout and Battleship. Thanks in advanced!
811,I’m not a data scientist yet but I just started my masters program to get a degree in data science. I took a class called numerical analysis for my math minor in my undergrad  and I absolutely loved it  way more than my degree in computer science. We basically spent the whole time analyzing big data sets using differential equations and programming in MATLAB. I was hooked. So I decided to pursue a degree where I can do more of that lol
812,This should surprise no one  except maybe the people I've seen in this sub who want so bad to work at a FAANG?   But at the end of the day people working at companies will usually justify it to themselves why they should work there. A few people will quit in protest and then speak out in documentaries like The Social Dilemma.
813,Funny how Nvidia sold us the 3080 was twice as fast as a 2080 when actually it's a lot closer to twice the performance of a 2060 Super or a 1080.  Still  a good bump that will definitely make Pascal users consider upgrading.  A 3080 requires a beefier PSU than a 1080  though.
814,Looks like your Apex wasn't running  were you able to get that sorted out?  You can do a lot with a mostly stock 86: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-i36V2EoPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-i36V2EoPg)
815,Yeah  you definitely want to go over recommended Watts  your cpu also will use more voltage during the increased graphics activity. I would go 1000W if my card was asking for at least 600  a quality 750W would work  but not the cheap ones.
816,Shhh  we don't mention panel fitment unless it's a Tesla because no other manufacturer would let that sort of flaw be sold to a customer.  But yeah  if I bought a Ferrari I'd be really angry if it didn't look nearly perfect.
817,I'm confused  the 3070 ti/super/whatever will have more ram than the 3080?  How is that going to work in terms of hierarchy?  I know vram isn't itself a performance indicator  but it seems odd that the 3070S would have higher specs than the 3080.
818,Brownish and creamy coolant is usually indicative of cross-contamination with oil or transmission fluid.  Is it an automatic transmission? Sometimes cars use dual-circuit radiators for engine coolant and transmission fluid  keeping both cool  but they can cross-contaminate if there's an internal leak.  Otherwise  yeah  could be a head gasket  could be rust  or both. Either way you can't just patch this problem with some goop in a bottle. :( A head gasket must be repaired at the source by removal and reinstallation of the cylinder head. Rust that bad means a fluid flush and likely the radiator itself will be so clogged with gunk that it won't be salvageable  you'll just have to replace it.  First things first you need to narrow down where the leak is coming from. It's usually a rubber hose that lets go first  but if it's at the engine block itself or the radiator it's going to require removal and replacement of the affected part. (I.e. if your radiator itself is leaking you really should be replacing it  not trying to use some stop-leak of some sort.)
819,In my opinion  Both company 1 and company 2 are doomed to fail. Sorry for sounding rude but this is how most companies fail in data science.   A good data scientist (i.e. focused deeply in math/stat) can never equal an experienced programmer. Similarly an experienced programmer can't equal a data scientist with deep math/stat knowledge.  In company 1  the data engineering would be shitty.   In company 2  the data science would be shitty (unless it is run of the mill data science problem like spam/no spam  house price prediction  simple recommender engine etc).  The sign of a company having mature Data Science team is that whether it has separated the role of a data scientist from that of a data engineer. You would be much better off in a company having such mature data science team given your background.
820,"Most current builds  at least the ones I see posted on tech subs  are very cable management focused. Some cases  like the Lian Li O11D  have an entire compartment just for cables and the PSU  and having at least a backplate with cutouts for cables seems to be common sense in even budget cases. This is due to both improved airflow  due to reduced air resistance with less cables  and also for aesthetics.  Wouldn't the ""evolution"" of this be to have the power connectors on the backside of the motherboard  with appropriated cutouts in the case for the power connectors directly instead of the cables  plus having labels stating which power connectors it is?  It would improve airflow / aesthetics more than what we currently have  not to mention that it would also make it simpler to troubleshoot if something happened with the cables  since you could just open one side of the case to check if there are any bad connections  instead of opening both sides.   All this said  is there any reason to why this hasn't been attempted yet? And if so  what possible flaws could it have when compared to current MoBos setup?"
821,*“It is abundantly clear from your feedback that integrating ads is not welcome.”*  ... uhh yeah. No shit  Sherlock. Aren’t these massive triple-A gaming companies *supposed* to be the experts? Shouldn’t they have a good grasp on what the consumer does or doesn’t welcome?  It’s not exactly a new discovery that people don’t like ads and micro transactions being crammed into full-price games. This is nothing but thinly-veiled PR  and I seriously wish major companies weren’t able to get away with this shit.  It ruins gaming  and I don’t really see an end in sight.
822,If your team is ultimately responsible for why this metric works/doesn't work  then I think it's fair to ask what's behind the curtain.   If the 3rd party insists on keeping everything secret then that's their right  but in return you should ask for SLA guarantees.  Because at this point it's basically like hitting a vendor API  and they're on the hook for support/fixes if stuff breaks.
823,Prob  not the best place to ask but I really don't have anywhere else so what are some good computers I can buy that isn't over the top extremely but they can run games well  and are in a budget of 500-750? I just want to be able to play simple games  I'm not running anything like VR or high graphic games just looking for a good pc with a bit of power.
824,Apparently so is giving a release date for the damn thing.  All we get is: 2020 / Fall 2020 / Holiday 2020 / Late 2020 / Definitely 2020.   I seriously expect the next word on it to be: *certainly not 2021*! ...And that is as close as we will get until a month before it drops. So good luck everybody in the chaos that is going to be pre-orders/reservations/pick-ups lol.
825,This is going to end badly.  Such a great game just not optimized for consoles. PC is the only place this game should be played.    I played it on an Xbox One X because of game pass.  I can't tell you how many times my sub was punctured and trapped by something in the environment that loaded in while I was traveling through the empty space it was supposed to be in.
826,I really like this theme song.  BB2 was a really rough PS4 port  but I still got deep into it and enjoyed myself despite the poor performance. Would love to see a more robust campaign in the sequel  but looking forward to this either way.
827,I’ve become really burnt out without data science. Everything about it has just been exhausting to me. Model building has become tedious  monotonous  and boring. We are only allowed to use specially tailored data from management for our models (which are probably fixed).   Honestly I’ve been looking at transitioning to robotics or app development. Those look way more engaging.   I was wondering if anyone here has transitioned away from data science? What field did you move to? Why did you move to it?   Could I strike out on my own?
828,Like with anything else  put in the time. Fail. Try to do better. Figure out what way of doing things suits you best. Stick to your strengths. Challenge your weaknesses. Try new things. Just don’t stop GMing and you’ll get better.
829,If you already like your laptop id say cloud computing might be a more economical option  and a lot of people use it so it could be a useful skillset.   If you're set on getting a machine ive been extremely happy with my dell precision 3530. You can get one with a xeon processor.   Of course dell support was pretty horrible  it shipped with a broken keyboard and they argued that they shouldnt have to replace it since i didnt buy their super special warranty package. Eventually after complaining a lot they fixed it though. Machines great  just a heads up.
830,Is it okay to share my favorite designs that I think aged well? Not much about actual driving experience. I’m young-ish  so these are picks mainly from when I started driving.   • (04-07) Acura TL (bonus for Type S factory appearance upgrades)  • (2012 - Now) Tesla Model S  • (2011 - Now?) Lexus GS  • E39 BMW 5-Series
831,Hello you data digging wizards!  I hope everyone is doing well in these crazy times. I wanted to see if there are any current or past employed data scientists on here that could shine some light on what an average day looks like? Any reposes to the below would be super interesting & very much appreciated :)  \- What data do you generate/work with? Customer  news  social data  sales  search data  numerical vs text based?  \- What languages and libraries do you use? Python  R  Java  matplotlib  pandas  numpy  scikit-learn?  \- What are the specific Machine Learning algos you use the most? Linear Regression  Naïve Bayes Classifier  Random Forest  K Means Cluster  Decision Trees?   \- What are the steps you take in data processing? Aggregating data  pre-processing data?  \- What are the outputs you deliver? Reports? Optimizations? Behavior analysis?  \- Typical meetings  timelines  deadlines?  \- What Industry?  Thank you and all the best   N
832,IRL you don't always use source data as-is when modeling. Often  you try to  impute data  or join with another  data source for other attributes so your model has more stuff to work on. In addition  there's the whole model deployment thing  and gathering business requirement from clients --> this sounds more complicated than it seems  trust me.
833,If you're coding and designing  you're started now. Great!   If you want to get hired at a studio or publisher  they're going to put a lot of emphasis on you having *some* degree  or you having attained some success on your own. I don't personally think a games-specific degree is a great strategy. Computer science  shorter programming-specific paths  all great. Business  marketing  anything else you're interested in  all great options. The game industry is a brutal place and you may find you want to preserve this as a hobby which means something else is going to need to pay the bills.
834,If you read the paper tho  time is the number of days for followup  something you can input. It's not when they died. So you can incorporate time as an input variable for the model  https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5/tables/1
835,"As a small indie game designer - I'd be delighted to receive a negative review and a half dozen positive reviews. If you like their other content **show it**. Then feel free to dis the stuff you don't like  they'll be better off with one stinker and 6 greats than with 7 ""no reviews"""
836,I wonder if the digital only version will have some benefit. Cheaper or larger storage?   I don't think I'll be buying this version of the PlayStation. I may hold of to see if they announce a visual refresh in a couple of years  I hate the way the box looks.
837,I suggest starting up a Kickstarter. That way you can see what other people think of your idea. You might be able to get that last bit of capital to finish your game. It's going to force you to work on the marketing side of your game which is really what you should be focusing on. Get a website and setup some simple business structure.  This is just general advise I dont have experience doing any of this.
838, I am currently in a Data Analyst role for a local government. I want to build my portfolio in hopes of moving into a more formal Data Science role. To achieve this  I plan to develop a series of projects in Kaggle  build out an inventory of tools to share on Git. I also plan to find new ways to implement ML or DL concepts in my present work using existing raw data  potentially including image data.    In my work  we work closely with a GIS team who curates our department’s geospatial data in ArcGIS. I am developing proficiency in Esri tools.    At this time  I am weighing the value of doubling down on filling gaps in my math education vs. developing stronger skills in Python/R/SQL. Or both on a longer timeline.   How valuable is it to use time to address this skill-gap? Taking college-level courses in calculus  multi-variable calculus  linear algebra and discrete math for example will take many years.    Realistically  I am at the beginning of this journey. I have a bachelors with a major in Anthropology with some focus in Archaeology  but I do not have a strong background in analytics. Although I can work through data science concepts and use data science tools on the computer  I suspect mathematical education to be a major hurdle.    I’m open to suggestions and know that any strong path forward will take a few years. I’m prepared to do the work but need to find the best way to optimize my time.    I am not opposed to doing master’s work  but I want to make sure my ducks are in a row and find the right program. Here are some details about my current credentials:  \-  Bachelors in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology   \-  Three years’ employment in a Grant Manager/Digital Resource Manager role in Nonprofit  \-  Current one years’ employment in a Data Analyst role in Gov’t  \-  Developing proficiency in Special Data Science  o  Took Esri’s Spatial Data Science MOOC   Is Data Science a realistic path forward? Is there another disciple that might make more sense to pursue that would better capitalize on my skills  like Geoanalytics? Should I prioritize math or computer learning?      Please give me your 100% real opinion. Thank you for any insight.
839,And as soon as they rose they sank.  The smaller cars literally made the brand relevant to many people who wouldn't usually buy one. The A45 is a stunning hothatch. And currently everything they make is better than bmw (I drive a bmw)  SUV are fucking stupid  and will soon fall out of favour as there going to be a shit shape for drag coefficient in EV vehicles.  The A C E S classes should stay and for fuck sake put maybach to bed  and focus on a higher tier of S class.       But yes now we're going to focus on something which will narrow our market and push away all the new customers our range had gathered.
840,I work in finance as a quant.  My colleagues and I very much qualify as data scientists:  we clean data  build statistical models using the usual tools. (R/Python/C++   Tensorflow  XGboost  sklearn  pymc  etc.)  program computers to build features and create predictive models using regression pipelines   backtest our models in and out-of-sample  hold research meetings to discuss results  and productionize our models.  All the usual stuff.  I personally know a handful of people who make ~$10 million/year as day-to-day working data scientists.  (Sadly  I am not one of them.)  I would say at several the firms I've worked at   the median pay was maybe $500k-$800k  but I knew quite a few people who made > $1 million per year and a handful who made $10 million/year or more without being executives or partners - they were actually active data scientists who spent most of their data doing research.  At that level you usually had a few junior quants below you  but I know a few who were really just absurdly productive individual contributors who made ~$5-10 million/year.
841,I'd add another one  Remember mental disorders are a *real thing*  there is a good chance that somebody at the table knows somebody with the disorder you are portraying... it could be their mother is schizophrenic and refuses to speak to them because they are a replecant  or a brother with  borderline personality disorder estranged for 5 years because they couldn't cope with the drama... and maybe a player actually has suffered from bipolar or anxiety or an eating disorder.
842,The title doesn't really say anything ... here's the TL DR/highlights:  * Arm highlights its next two generations of CPUs  codenamed Matterhorn and Makalu  with up to a 30% performance uplift * Starting with Arm’s 2022 IP  all future Cortex-A “big” cores will only support 64-bit  * Arm’s updated Client roadmap delivers a Total Compute approach with an emphasis on performance  security  and developer access
843,"No. The compiler will be able to generate better code than you could by hand. And the kind of projects that require optimized code at an assembly level are not the ones you're going to make anyways (we're talking *cutting edge* AAA games here  so not even ""regular"" AAA). Focus on top-level culling instead. Actually... don't even think of performance until you have an actual game ready  with actual performance issues."
844,So  here's the thing...I've been in a data science career for a decade  now. If the version of me from 10 years ago tried to get into the field now  he wouldn't stand much of a chance. Even just before the pandemic  the job market was ridiculously competitive. Now  it's even worse.  This doesn't mean that it's impossible for you to get your foot in the door. But if it happens  it will likely take a LOT of time and a LOT of patience.
845,In the settings I create  I don't have a higher power of any sort.  In part  this is because that's just how my own beliefs work  but also because I completely and utterly suck at using deities in any fashion at all.  Relatedly  I would never present myself as the highest god of a universe - not enough ego for that  for starters lol.  However  when I do Play-by-Post  while I'm setting up threads for each chapter  I usually have a little write up of myself setting the scene like it's a 3d graphical output (much like the Unreal Dev Kit setting up levels for a game).  Mostly just for fun (and to stall out some time while I get my prep work together).
846,Hi guys  I’m new to computers and am trying to build one myself. I already have a computer but it’s not that good for gaming. So far I have the Nvidia 950 TI  an i7 Intel cpu and 4GB of RAM. I’m not trying to spend too much money  so I would love some recommendations for upgrades for some of these and maybe some good accessories like 144hz monitors or gaming mice. For the first couple of upgrades I’ll be doing my budget will be around 500? Thanks :).
847,Wow  unfortunate. They were my [favorite sounding](https://youtu.be/eDjLovtcXW8) F1 engine of the V6 hybrid era. Seeing Red Bull and Toro Rosso (both Honda powered) get a win and podium in Brazil 2019 with the Honda guys all happy left a good feeling in my heart.
848,Some parts of the job are a slog for me.  I find that putting a model into production is all fine and good  but writing SQL queries to analyze performance takes forever. It's some combination of not being in control of all of the tables needed  not having a great way to iterate on the query itself so it's hard to debug issues (we use a custom tool to get around db permissions)  and long feedback loops when building airflow DAGs.  I'm curious what others find to be difficult.
849,Projects where the CSV output needs to be delivered for later parsing. Most data analysis projects on a small scale. A LOT of projects where the modules (for whatever reason) are in different languages.   Although in many of those cases I prefer to use JSON.
850,The truth is in the longetivity. Growing up my family could only afford the replacement part  so the cars were out of commission every 6 months  if not more often. The problem with this is that if you dont maintain it more often when you hear a noise or see wear  catastrophic failure will rear its head.
851,How did you like the 10/10ths HPDE? I've only done the corvette anniversary HPDE weekend and then a Just Track It one (but I didn't get to experience that whole weekend due to mechanical issues.)  I need to get my car back at that track. I miss it really badly and my car is way better now.
852,I recently bought and started fixing a 2004 Ford Focus SVT with \~145000 miles. I plan on keeping the car around for a while to start learning how to work on cars. How would I go about finding out if the motor is in good enough shape to have some kind of forced induction setup? I wouldn't try and do this myself  but I'm curious. I understand the motor is higher compression  so I don't plan on forcing a lot of boost through it  but I know it can take somewhere around 8psi with a tune and bolt ons. Any suggestions and info would be great!
853,Gains look impressive but the the price increase just evens it out to make it meh. No one wants to pay more for the same incrementally better 6-8 core CPUs we've had since 2017. Admittedly zen is GOOD now  but still  i feel like all the best gains happened like 1-2 years after i bought last (7700k here) and now things are starting to stagnate again.  Bring on 12-16 core standards with DDR5 already.
854,Yeah  my country was surprisingly free of these smartphone and TV ads  but yesterday I got my first ad on my 2020 Samsung TV  it wasn't obstructive or big(it was a small icon-like ad on the left edge of the menu)  but it was annoying  I didn't pay a lot of money for a TV to get fucking ads on it  especially because Samsung has been degrading in picture quality year-on-year in the past 3-4 years.  I'll be honest  I'd understand and support these ads IF their TVs would actually increase or at least keep their quality while staying at the same or lower price  but not like this.
855,I would never use any pressure stronger than a spray nozzle attachment on a garden hose. If it needs more pressure than that it's almost certainly safer to just rinse and use a clean soapy washcloth to remove the grime.

Tho I was caught totally off guard and was absolutely touched and hurt by the beautiful yet depressing end. I totally recommend it.

860,"There are a couple of ways to think about this:  **What is your ""other thing"" to invest time in?**   That is  if instead of spending time getting a second masters you are going to spend your time doing X  what is X?  For some  X is just spending more time in your current job  doing better work  getting raises/promotions/etc.  For some  X is getting rest. It's about taking care of yourself and gamble that a well rested  motivated  happy version of you can accomplish more than a tired  overworked version of you.  For some  X is playing video games till 2 in the morning  getting 4 hours of sleep and drinking too much.  You need to figure out what you are going to do with your time otherwise.  **What is your end goal?**  Is your end goal to get that high-profile  super technical Principal Scientist/Sr. Staff Data Scientist job at a tech company? Then it may be worth it to get a second masters to round out your profile.   Here's the tricky thing with degrees - they often don't matter... until they do.  The same is true of certain types of experience. Often times what experience you get doesn't matter.... until it does.  That is  until the job you want in the company you want *needs* (read: wants) a specific skillset  accreditation  degree  experience  etc. for your dream job.   Now  it's often impossible to know in advance a) what your dream job is  or b) what skills they're going to want you to have  but you can take a stab and then shape your career based on that.  To give you an example: The company I spent my first 2.5 years at after grad school was key in me getting the job i have now (which was 3 jobs later). The combination of skills and the network that I built there was able to lay dormant for 3 years and come back all of the sudden to be a huge asset - for this one company  at this one moment in time.  What's the point of all of this?  If you think of your ideal job - do you think there is any chance that they are going to *demand* someone with a MS in Statistics or Data Science?"

864,I still disagree that lootboxes are gambling. Gambling implies you can get something back. In video games you only get in game items not money. If lootboxes are to be banned then so must TCG they are the same thing. In fact you could argue TCG is actually more like gambling because you can resell valuable cards and potentially make a profit
865,If you want something easier to write/use than C++ but faster than Python I'd argue Java is a decent option  but unless you compile your game natively you'll suffer from a big RAM footprint. Also depending who you ask it's not more enjoyable than C++ for everyone. It's quite verbose but to me personnaly not as annoying to use.  Rust is very fast  like C/C++ fast  but Rust is still young  I'm not sure how much support for the features you'll need exists yet  and any update could break your code (one of my friends is currently writing an OS with Rust. A random Cargo update broke his pipeline out of nowhere). Fun to use and very promising  but you'll be an early-adopter.   C# is quite nice too but sort of similar to Java. I'd look at these two and see which one you prefer  they're a good compromise of high-level and high-performance even though both have their issues.
866,I really liked this game and I thought the motion controls worked well  but I understand some people’s frustration with it. A switch port makes a lot of sense and has an opportunity to win over  some of the players who didn’t like the Wii Remote way of playing.
867,But don't most gamers build their own?  It is a rite of passage and has replaced pimping cars and I bet these (significant!?) numbers are not included.  If you aren't a gamer I can't imagine why anyone would buy a desktop over a laptop.  I mean with a laptop you get a screen  keyboard mouse  webcam all in one.  Desktops are often short some of these and buying is a minefield as a result.
868,"well this anime has started off to being the complete opposite of what I was expecting from the PV's/ Which was: ""Gymnast who should retire but doesn't want to  and struggles on to keep going. Meanwhile  younger  possibly more talented gymnasts are trying to take the mc's place as top gymnast. Meanwhile mc has to cope with loss of wife and raise young child.""  And while that still might end up being the case  this was far more comedic then I thought it would be? The mc is kinda immature with a personality like a teenager  but then has moments of acting like a normal adult/father to his daughter. The Matrix references were totally bizarre. Not even sure what to say about all the other bizarre elements  Giant pet bird that can speak almost like a normal human being? Bishie foreigner ninja guy who I guess has the potential to become a serious gymnast  but he's also totally cooky and immature???   The animation quality is about on par what I thought it would be. the CG for the gymnastics really stands out  and I worry that they are gonna rely too heavily on the CG to cut corners with the action/gymnastic sequences instead of animating it in 2D. Yet the rest of the animation was pretty ....not..great.  I know I'm being super-negative here  I didn't hate it by any means  I honestly don't know what to think of it. Prolly didn't help that I was a little buzzed on booze when I watched this so I had a harder time processing wtf I just watched...I'll def watch the next episode to get a better feel for this anime."

870,Probably a dumb question but might as well ask it.  If I'm using Python to analyze data  creating a scraper to get my data  using libraries like Numpy  Pandas  matplotlib to analyze my data  and creating some functions to do specific tasks  am I scripting or programming?  Yeah I know  not the best question but I really don't know.
871,Is there any professional certification on statistical time series forecasting? I recently took a course on time series analysis as part of my master’s degree in analytics and even though I learned a lot  it was too focus on theory. I would like to take a course or certification that would help me to gain a practitioner’s perspective on the topic. I'm not as interested on the math/statistics itself but on its use to solve real life problems. I don't want to take Coursera courses. They tend to be either too simple/shallow or too academic. Is there any association of professional time series forecasters? That would help as well.
872,I have a 2017 Pacifica that has been at the dealership for 3 months now. It went in for a misfire on 2 cylinders and has apparently been a nightmare for the service department. The car is at roughly 92 000 miles so it’s past the factory warranty but luckily I bought an extended warranty which I was told will cover the work.   The diagnosis was the wiring harness is bad. After 2 separate wiring harnesses and 12 weeks of working with Chrysler to check individual connectors and that the engine mechanicals(compression check  valve spring check  looking for sludge buildup) are all good I’m told it has a rough idle. Now the dealership tells me they are waiting on Chrysler for direction and pretty much praying for divine intervention at this point due to the fact that the fault seems to be an intermittent electrical gremlin.  At this point I’m scared they will call it done and a week later the fault will show up and I’ll be shit out of luck. I’m wondering if Chrysler has any obligations/responsibility when it comes to this even though it is past the factory warranty?
873,# I told you  Last update (a little bit NSFW): https://youtu.be/fubdPTJev4o  I’ve been working for a year on this story-driven tactical action game but everything indicates that [my Kickstarter campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/itoldyou-thegame/kickstarter-not-ready) will go nowhere. Anyway  at least I’d like to know your opinion.  An alpha demo is already available [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388890).  Bonus answer: FIFA 2021
874,Hey all! I've been taking the IBM Data Science Specialization through Coursera as my first foray into the world of DS. Loving it so far  and seeing how much I grossly underestimated how diverse DS is.   Starting grad school next week and trying to get a head start on skills for the future. My job goals are somewhere between policy/community planning analysis. I'm curious to know if anyone here is using DS skills in urban planning  policy research  nonprofit  government  etc.. and what kind of software/proficiencies are important for daily tasks.
875,Few years back I encountered a website of an rpg system which was still in development. Ot was about crushed world full of debris floating around with humans and other races living there. There was some Discovery League or something which explored still unknown places. There was also something like ancient teleportation technology and stuff and it claimed it will be very light on violent due to kids being main recipients. Also I think it was Finnish-made.
876,I think my main problem is letting my players get away with leaving too many loose ends.   Every campaign ends with loads of plot points that didn’t go anywhere because the players got distracted doing something else and I chickened out of bringing the full consequences to bear  and worse  I know that by doing this again and again I’m conditioning them to not worry about it.
877,I’m somebody that happily hated gta online for the past few years.   I tried it out as I saw it was leaving gamepass. This was also a similar time to when my countries lockdown started  and I was blown away by the online mode. Perhaps being in a digital city helped me when I couldn’t really leave my apartment for months.   The only money I’ve used was to get the ‘starter pack’ which gives you some properties and cars.   The amount of modes is incredible. I’ve been playing the races and missions. Some of these modes give you access to the dlc vehicles which cost real money  so it’s a way to use the toys without spending money.  The formula 1 mode is incredible. Some of the races have been so much fun  such as the one where one team of 4 batman cars have to stop another team of 3 super strong cars and 1 bus which has to reach a checkpoint.   Flying the fighter jet in first person feels like it’s own game. There’s just a tonne of content here since they’ve been updating it for like 6 years now.  The biggest drawback are the loading times between events and if next gen sorts this  I’ll be heading back into Los Santos.
878,Back in the day when I was still in highschool  Jalopnik was like my drug. When others would be out getting high during lunch breaks  I would be reading patiently of the legends of Daddy Doug  Tavarish  David Tracey and his ever growing n+1 collections of Jeep’s amongst the plethora of other talented writers. Sadly  once the whole Gawker fiasco  I left and never looked back. Farewell to my beloved  Jalopnik
879,The catch is that living expenses skyrocket if you want at house with a good school nearby that is not far from work.  For a single young person (or dual income no kids) that doesn't care about school districts etc.? It's pretty dope to live like that for a few years in a small apartment and basically secure your retirement by age 25.

882,"I'm trying to block websites using [this] (https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/how-to-block-any-website-on-your-computer-phone-or-network-588357) method  and I get through everything fine until I need to save the system 32 file. My computer says ""You don't have permission to save in this location. Contact the administrator to obtain permission."" This is the only account on this laptop and it's set to admin. Is there anything I can do?"
883,Idk  it really depends. There’s a local guy around me but he always over charges for simple stuff. I try to avoid this guy but really I don’t like taking my car to pep boys or Firestone. so I just end up doing stuff myself if I can.
884,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NM2fFpzPKPg  it makes a noticeable difference when even within the same cpu. the difference between one cpu and multiple sockets would be much more noticeable  especially if your program isnt numa aware  if your platform has numa.  numa=non uniform memory access
885,btw it also depends what platforms are you aiming for  if memory serves me correctly unity is works for all of them of the bat. I had to make similar choice  and me being alone made me lean towards unity as the easiest choice. I think you being part of a team can go for the overkill and try with unreal engine  with that you can make killer graphics.
886,Ofc it'll matter.  There's two types of games: Your average game that runs fine on midrange hardware at high res and high framerates  and graphical showcase games that strain even the highest end computers.  Examples of the latter are Control  cyberpunk  metro exodus.  Those showcase games always tend to include every latest bit of tech available. You can safely expect most if not all demanding games on pc to include DLSS support.  Random esports stuff and less ambitious multiplats (graphically) will probably see less support  but it'll matter less as 4k 60 will be easy on those.  &#x200B   &#x200B   On top of that  DLSS is being implemented into UE4 (and will be in UE5 no doubt) on an engine level. It's by far the most popular engine for multiplatform games so there'll be a lot of DLSS games by default.  &#x200B   You can also be sure that the next big games like battlefield etc will support it and future COD games.
887,now publish your R model as an API product or publish your data transformations as a continuously executing pipeline or turn your R process into a library engineering can use.  here's an agnostic answer to your question though. IMO  it's the information age  there's really not a job/industry that doesn't benefit from being able to automate parts of their lives (programming)
888,"Let's say you are a data scientist. Your typical year will consist of:  - Project management  project planning  dealing with stakeholders  politics....  - Teamwork  collaboration etc..  - Poking at data  looking at graphs  thinking about how things fit together  engineering new features  - Programming  - Actual statistics/math/information theory/ML   I'd expect a junior data scientist at your typical company (so not FAANG or some AI startup) to spend 99% of their time on other things than fancy statistics/ML.  If you know how matrices and vectors work and what a derivative means  if you did a basic college level statistics course... you're good to go.  What I'd focus on is to learn programming. From SQL all the way to making rest API's and dashboards with javascript. Because on a team of physicists  statisticians and mathematicians  you'll be a god for figuring out how to set up a CI/CD pipeline to test and deploy a REST api or how to create a simple dashboard with javascript.  The company I work for stopped hiring people from ""quantitative backgrounds"" and straight up only hires people that have a software engineering background as a basic requirement. In practice it's big data/scientific computing/ML people with CS degrees or at least a lot of courses done. Plenty of physicists and engineers basically have most of the CS coursework done and could have easily switched majors on paper.  In a typical data science pipeline  only a tiny fraction is actually ""the model"". It is stupid to spend so much time and effort on something that is so insignificant in the big picture.  In practice  AutoML beats most data scientists. Most data scientists are incapable of delivering results in a reasonable timeframe. You give them a task  but you'll never get the results you want. They'll get stuck trying to build the data pipeline or they'll get stuck trying to deploy it to production. Most will get stuck on step 1 because they can't figure out how to set up data pipelines. Even then building the models and making sure they work takes a very long time and the results aren't any better than just by using AutoML.  The current team buildup is basically data engineers  data analysts (PowerBI ftw) and ML engineers. Data scientists don't really fit in anymore.  I've heard of ""full stack data scientists"" which is basically the same as above  except you just call everyone data scientists."
889,The term you're looking for is Uplift modeling. Assuming you spend a period of time randomly assigning the slogans and can measure the historical results  you could get pretty good results by just building a predictive model that predicts probability to buy  with the slogan used as an input variable (along with age and everything else you know). For a new patron  simply run all 20 scenarios and pick the one with the highest probability.
890,I’ve never understood it ether.  When I buy a car I buy which meets all of the needs/wants in a certain budget.  I am a huge Mopar fan at the moment simply because I think they make the most wacky and fun stuff without caring about much else. I still want to own a corvette  an lc500  a 911  an STI  etc etc regardless of brand.
891,For what purposes?  At work: when they give you the title.  During a job search: if you know Python/R  SQL  and know how to train/test a linear regression  logistic regression  k means  CART  random forest  and xgboost.  To your non-DS friends: if you know Python or R.  To your parents: if you can restart their computer.
892,>summarise data using one command came as quite a shock.  You're going to need to change your pants once you find out about [pandas-profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html).
893,"Take USB4  jazz it up as far as its going to get jazzed  call it VSB for Versatile Serial Bus  and then tell everyone its ""one more"" than USB.  One standard  reboot  no confusion. It's either nasty old version soup USB or the new VSB  does it have  a port or not?"
894,One idea is to apply something like word2vec  where contexts are given by orders  in order to represent items as vectors.  Then  you can apply your favourite clustering algorithm.  Slightly more detail  train classifier where positive examples consist of items purchased together and negatives consist of pairs of items chosen at random.  This technique is usually called negative sampling.
895,Mh i think you should stop change rules of ded and just play other games. Ded is not even good at beeing ded anymore  there are other fantasy rpg who works better. You like dungeon crawling? Play dungeon world or IC RPG. You like dark fantasy and skills? Play Simbarum. You think Eberon is fun and innovative? Play spire or shadow run.
896,"It's viable  but I feel like it's a necessary component. The type of writing you do will determine which direction you take your data science career. I'll get to this as my second point.  My first point will be that storytelling is essentially communication. Generally  you'll need to convey your results clearly to each respective audience. How I present my analysis to the CEO is going to be different as compared to my manager  as compared to my similarly analytical peers.  1. The CEO would probably want to hear the recommendation and the top 1-2 points that support your hypothesis. 2. Your manager will most likely want to see your train of thought  the path of logical work and reasoning that led up to your conclusions  and your final recommendations. 3. Your analytical peers will question why you decided to use a particular normalizing parameter  and perhaps comment on the large standard deviations.  Cater your communication to the correct audience  and that will peg you as a data scientist who knows how to communicate to the correct audience. That alone will get you farther than just raw technical ability.  My second point is simply which category you would like to focus on. Data science is a large field  and unless you have highly specific knowledge  most ""data scientists"" (including myself)  are technical product analysts. Nothing wrong with that  and I speak mostly for myself. I still work across the board in Python  SQL  R  and have some knowledge and elements of engineering  but for the most part  I don't touch production code like a machine learning engineer might. That doesn't mean you're powerless. In fact  I would say the contrary.  For me  I've been moving towards product management  which complements really well with data science if you know how to communicate. This means forming clear hypotheses  knowing how to measure the outcomes of particular experiments  and making coherent recommendations to executives to change the product itself. This comes from long-form storytelling  which is an art form that has slightly died in our 140-character  meme-filled culture. Clarity in thought and writing is quite rare nowadays  and it's a skill that I would recommend mastering. That will take you beyond even data science.  I'm happy to proofread or give constructive comments on any type of writing that you currently do at work if you so please. I'd be curious to understand better what your definitions of ""page turning narratives is"" and perhaps how you plan on shifting your thinking. You can DM me anytime."
897,I graduated with a BS in CS in 1997.  I'm a full-stack webapp developer and have worked for 2 Fortune 100 companies (1 Finance and 1 Healthcare). Currently  I mostly use Java (Spring)  SQL and HTML  CSS  JS  jQuery & Fusion Charts  and I'm responsible for building reports and adding new features to our portal.   No regrets going with CS... always have been able to find a job and pay has been good.  I am pretty good with SQL and it is probably my favorite language (I think could write SQL all day)  but I don't know a lot of statistics other than the basics. I don't really ever do any complicated math so my limited stats background has never been an issue.  We do have more stats focused people working on our team doing some pretty fancy stuff with modeling and machine learning on Azure... usually these guys figure out what the reports should look like but by the time the report specs get to me  the math is pretty straight forward... the reality is that few end-users want to see more than rates  sums  counts and averages.  I personally find programming more interesting than stats and see writing code as solving puzzles -- I almost never get bored.  I'm also somewhat of a jack of all trades so am pretty good at being useful which is probably another reason I've never had a problem finding a job.  I recommend whatever you do  you learn SQL... It should be required for most people working in the business world IMO. Good luck.
898,The only game genre that comes to mind that uses this model are interactive narrative games such as the games that were made by Tell Tale (RIP)  or Life is Strange. The first Episode of the game is Free  and subsequent episodes are paid DLC
899,Well one little thing I can already point out here was that the guy had Motion Blur off in the settings.    I dont know what it was set to with the Nvidia demonstration and I dont know what kind of performance impact this would have to explain any differences  but I thought it'd be worth noting.
900,There’s a whole #ownvoices movement going on but the point is to make sure that there are enough XYZ people writing about their own XYZ experiences  and we don’t only hear about XYZ people from writers who are ABC.  Nobody’s gonna tell you not to write NB characters because you’re not NB. Just like nobody’s gonna tell you not to put men in your work if you are a woman.  Just head over to one of the enbee subreddits or something and figure out what the vibe is  so you don’t misrepresent. Don’t be like JK Rowling  who named a character Cho Chang because she couldn’t be bothered to research plausible Chinese names.
901,Greetings r/Cars! I noticed yesterday that [my car was idling pretty loud](http://imgur.com/a/m1ZOhUH) when I had my windows cracked in my garage. It is a ticking sound  like it might be the injectors but I was hoping for some more experienced ears to speculate on what it might be.   Thanks for your time!
902,"I recognize you are no longer DMing this  but his comment indicates a problem with what he expects from the game as opposed to what you are presenting. His ""unbalanced encounters"" means he thinks his character was supposed to do what he had it do. (This may have been reinforced by rescuing the PC.) In fact you had designed the encounter expecting that his character to follow orders.   Strategically I think there are things you can do to avoid this in the future.  1. Talk to the players about threat levels. If you plan to have them see things where their smartest option is to run away or not engage  let them know. 2. If a player indicates their character is doing something that is insane/suicidal/doesn't make sense give the scene as you've set it  call their attention to it. While PCs will sometimes willingly and knowingly take insane risks  in most cases this indicates a significant misunderstanding of the environment as you intended it. (That is they have not understood what you have tried to tell them.) I surmise this is what happened in your case. When you say  ""saw massacre his superiors"" if he isn't thinking several paladins each with three times my levels and is instead thinking ""bureaucratic superiors who give orders but are REMFs with a couple of levels of something not fight relevant"" his actions make sense and lead to the thought that he is supposed to save the day. 3. Talk about expectations from the game. This is good in a session 0 but also helpful through a campaign.   While I agree there are some threat assessment issues  here  I think a mis match in underlying expectations lead to the incorrect threat assessment."
903,Before I start  I'm just gonna say now that I know basically nothing about cars.  Okay  so I bought a 2009 honda civic from a used car dealership  and the people who owned it previously had cut the springs themself in order to lower it. For some reason I have to push really hard on the brakes to make the car stop  and I noticed that it feels exactly the same on my friends car which was also lowered in the same way. Does this issue with the brakes have anything to do with the way my car was lowered? I plan on getting the springs replaced whether they're the problem or not  mainly because I was told by a mechanic that my car is too low for a body kit and it would just scrape on the floor  but if changing the springs will also make my brakes feel better then that's just an added bonus lmao. Let me know what you guys think  whether the issue is with the cut springs  or if it's just something completely different. Thanks in advance for any help!
904,Would love to play it when it's out. I'm also positively surprised by the nice feedback most others write here on reddit  although I would have expected more people to hate the art style since it looks a bit out of date. Wondering why that is - but it is very nice.
905,BLS reports 15% increase in the number of jobs in the next decade  which is about 4 times higher than the national average. Depending on how popular this field becomes  we should expect to see new higher-education programs devoted to DS. This will potentially cause DS to become even faster growing than it is now. As for saturation  no one can really tell for certain but it looks like we still have lots to explore in this field.

906,It's like Kino's journey through and through from what the novel readers are saying and from the second episode it seems so. It's not comfy sort of anime just different aspects of life. It's not depressing level of darkness  *yet*. It's a fun watch with the bad stuff mixed in   It's a nice watch.
907,Honestly it's this kind of thing which for me justifies buying a slightly higher sku model of a card.  I'm still on a 970 but it's the EVGA FTW+ and I paid a bunch more for it  mostly because it came with a backplate vs the other models  but also because I know they do spend a bit more on the components of these cards rather than the FE's.
908,"my experience w/the anime was  that I binge-read the manga after watching  the insanity that was ep 1. SO I knew what to expect with the finale of the anime...but still  I'd argue I preferred the anime version  minus the fact that things were crazy rushed in the final ep. Miki's death was more emotionally impactful to me. Her character in the manga wasn't really well written/developed. I only really felt for her character when she was getting murdered. But in the anime they had Miki's friendship with the other Miki who turned into the spider Devilman.  The final face off btw Akira and Satan/Ryou was kinda rushed  but iirc it was pretty rushed in the manga too. I remember some lgbtq fans got pretty salty that Ryou didn't say the line that they realized they had fallen in love with Akira. But in the manga  they say they loved Akira because ""they were a hermaphrodite"" asjhksggfdk which isn't really pc by today's standards  so I can see why it was left out. Also Ryou says that line to this three-headed demon guy in the manga  but they only appeared for a few secs in the anime  and gets insta-killed by Devilman Akira earlier in the ep.  Yet unlike in the manga  the anime shows Satan/Ryou crying over AKira's dead body  realizing how they fucked it all up  and then you see all the angels coming down to reset everything. Plus the song playing during that whole scene is go good.  I've still never re-watched the anime though...don't know if I can bring myself to"
909,im buying a palit gtx460 (refurb for cheap) with 2x6pin connectors but my psu only has one 6+2 pin connector im planning on buying a 8 pin to dual 6 pin connector  problem is it draws 160w which is 10w more than the 150w that 8 pin connector supports. the only way it could probably get 160w is getting power from the pcie x16 slot.  TLDR buying a refurb gtx460(160w) card that need 2 6pin connectors  does the pcie slot provide power and do 8pin to dual 6 pin power connector work?
910,I have an E39 with 205K on the clock. I love it. I want to hit 300K at least. Should I drop in an LSD to make winter easier? Maybe supercharge it down the line?  I also have an NA miata with 230K on the clock that's sitting in my garage with a dead cylinder. Still gets compression though  but I probably need to replace the fuel rail and injectors at the least.  Which one do I waste my time and money on? Should I sell the Miata and move on? It's been sitting for years.
911,Instead of using dice  the DM thinks of a range of numbers between 1-20 and the player “rolls” by choosing a number between 1-20. If it falls within the GM’s chosen range  it succeeds.  For example  on a DC 15  the DM could choose 5-20 or 16-11. You can even use the same bonuses as a normal 5e game but you’d probably want to pare it down to the bare bones.  Edit: You could make it easier  if you want to give a small chance of success  say ‘think of a number between 1-4’ and then shout the number at the same time. If you want to make the check harder  increase the range. If their character is good at the check  allow them to add/minus 1 or more. From their guess
912,*Blades in the Dark.*  Our scoundrels are making their way up the outside of the tower called Crow's Nest  hidden inside boxes of supplies. The Crows get suspicious. Sallis gets irritable and starts shooting. The boxes stop moving  the alarm is raised  we're stuck in flimsy wooden crates hanging from ropes half way to the top of the tower and the Crows are shooting back.  As the Crows rally at the lip of the roof  Sallis makes an executive decision  severing the ropes to catapult her up where she can deal with these upstarts face to face. The other crate  containing her sister Slane and their associate  Mister Brogan  starts swinging towards the tower wall.  Slane manages to snatch Mister Brogan's ghost key from inside his jacket and activate it just before impact  opening a memory of the time when the bricked up window before them was a masterpiece of stained glass  and they landed safely inside the tower in a flurry of spectral shards. And then as they recover themselves  they find the Crow's whisper is using that room as her personal sanctum...

914,"AWD means the car sends power to all 4 wheels through a center differential between the front and rear.  ""4WD"" means the car sends power to all 4 wheels with no differential action between front and rear.  That's it.    Some vehicles (like the Toyota Land Cruiser) have center differentials which can be locked.  When unlocked they would be AWD   and when locked they would be 4WD."
915,I just posted this on this sub  but udemy has some data science courses and they’re 90% off (around $10 per class) through 8/27. It’s a good low-cost option. I’m taking the Python bootcamp course and it’s good so far.

917,Real 5D underwater chess by Nvidia by artificially limiting the number of cards available to have the first few customers make the beta test for them.  In all seriousness though  any new  cutting edge tech has its teething problems and Ampere is no different. The fix will probably roll out before most people can even get their hands on a 3080 anyway.
918,OSE and Blades in the Dark are excellent choices! Here's some very varied suggestions:  I would add: *Fate Core* or *Accelerated*  *Apocalypse World*  *Trail of Cthulhu* or *Night's Dark Agents*  *Genesys* or FFG's *Star  Wars*  *Tales from the Loop*  *Legacy*
919,"[CPU scaling with the 3080 at Tom's Hardawre](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ampere-cpu-scaling-benchmarks)  Extremely interesting. Hopefully it kills off any dumb questions of ""will my CPU be the bottleneck?"""
920,Death note and Full metal Alchemist!! These two animes are literally the zero pre-requisite knowledge animes. We get know everything in the anime without having to go search on internet (which happened to me for GoH recently.)
921,How do you like that Kano laptop? Was it issued to you by a school? How well does it work? At one point our rep recommended those to use as a replacement for Chromebooks and we opted against taking the chance.
922,HARP/Rolemaster has a magic system very similar to what you describe where spells start of fairly basic but as the magic user gets more skilled they can pour more mana (power points) into the spell utilising greater effects (more damage  more targets  etc)
923,"I guess the bright side is that at the very least this ends up getting Nvidia to waste/lose a lot of its money.   It kind of reminds me of AT&T acquiring DirecTV for $40 billion  everyone on the board patting themselves on the back for making such a ""smart"" merger  only to whine about losing cable customers and having to cut costs a couple of years later because they overextended themselves with the acquisition.  If Nvidia stops having virtually unlimited amounts of money AMD will actually have a chance to catch up again. Intel made the same mistakes over the past decade  throwing $7 billion on this  $10 billion on that  another $15 on something else  only to wake up one day with AMD as a dangerous competitor that's starting to dominate them product wise."
924,"My way of introducing narrative control to the players is by listening to their statements of ""It would be cool if..."" Naturally  the players don't always use those words  but going with their ideas can be really fun.  For example  last session the players were heading into the desert to find buried ruins. When they stopped at an outrider fort to resupply and get news  one of the players said ""we'll probably need [desert clothing]."" Yes. Yes  the party needs to buy proper clothing to deal with the weather  and here's a Fortitude save to justify the need for the purchase.   Once the players got to the location  on a whim I described pillars shaped like guards standing on top of the hills they were searching. ""I'll bet these pillars are all looking at the real location."" Yes  turns out the pillars ARE looking at roughly the same point  it's right HERE on your map.  I'm sure they'll catch on eventually  but it's fun in the meantime  and it lets the players feel smart for figuring something out."
925,Python is kind of a do it all language  extremely versatile for all kinds of work. In the real world  you might not only have to do data analysis but complicated deep learning models (I’m tasked with computer vision rn). Python can do all that
926,Okay  this might be a stupid question  but.... If they have the technology to detect an AFK player quickly  and they have bots that are capable of playing at a very basic level of competency  why don't they have a bot take over an AFK player? The team might still be at a disadvantage but at least with ARAMs and non-ranked matches they might still be enjoyable...
927,Don't mix data science with data base and development  data science is a unique field of research based methodologies bring statistics and machine learning to solve complex problems.  Think like this you would rather find a person who could implement convolution function to pixels to generate third  simulate the data  look for fast convergence methods.  Compared to a person whose answer would be to use deep learning and see what pops up.   Search for stats senior or econometrics senior  they should have deep knowledge of stats  numerical methods like gradient convergence  structural change detection etc.  Theoretical profise along with basic programming skills should suffice.  Don't mix data science with data engineering or database expertise data scientist are not supposed to know it.  Jack of all trades can't promise you the desired vision and solutions when picking data scientist
928,If I put a charger that I put in my personal HP Lenovo laptop to charge connected to the house WiFi that had a personal private document on it into my school computer HP Chromebook connected to the house WiFi will the school see the personal words? I did this and now I’m scared the school can see my personal words! Help! Please! 🙏
929,The role that you seek are also called Business Intelligence Analyst/Engineer. You probably are in the right line but in the wrong team. Try to transition to tech teams where your interests align better
930,I work a $15/hour blue collar job  but have significantly more money on hand due to an inheritance. I could go out and get my dream car (non-1LE ZL1) right now  but part of the reason why I don't is that I don't want my coworkers knowing that I actually have a lot more money than them.
931,When that’s just how SSDs are made.  By the time games really need that kind of speed  if they ever do  any average SSD you would want will be capable of it.  For now any ssd is fine.  Hell for Forza Horizon 4 the difference between my Xbox One X SSD and my PC NVME  is there  but negligible.  From HDD I consider the game  unplayable.
932,Unpopular Opinion but with all these articles saying that the Honda Ridgeline finally looks like a truck just means that all trucks look the same and there's almost no difference between them other than who makes them.  I for one actually thought the Ridgeline has looked like the best truck visually throughout the years and now you take the badge off and it's just a copy paste of all the other trucks.
933,"Politics is always a controversial topic  so let me put this **disclaimer**:  * I am not here to promote or argue about my personal political views  * I am not here to complain about ""too much politics in games""  * I am not interested in subconscious  implicit  or unintentional politics - if the author says they don't stand for X  then (for the purposes of this thread) their RPG is not X  * I am mostly just curious.  \_\_\_\_\_\_  Most RPGs that I've read are either apolitical  or seem to try to promote some type of left-wing politics. E.g. from the preface to Lancer:  > We think it important also to acknowledge that both Tom and I are writing from the perspective of straight  cis  able-bodied men. When writing Lancer  we wanted to create a setting where humanity is – in the narrative present – at once in a state of utopia and working to affect it. We imagine that Union isn’t burdened by the same cultural definitions of gender that oppress and malign so many people who live under the umbrella of capitalism and empire and  as such  there is a wide spectrum of expression and identity in Union and among its constituent worlds.   I find it interesting that RPGs can be a tool for political discussion or activism. But it's virtually always the kind of politics described above. This is in contrast to a wide diversity of views purported by Appendix N authors - there's Moorcock  le Guin  Mieville  but also Tolkien  Anderson  Lovecraft  Howard.  Do you know any RPGs that could be described as politically centrist or right-wing? The only thing that comes to mind is the infamous MYFAROG (mostly known for its author and not the content itself). I also tried googling it and found [The Price of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_of_Freedom_(role-playing_game))  which is a rather obscure game about Americans fighting Soviet invaders. Is there anything else?"
934,For clarification  only the 750 will be produced with 8nm. 875 will be made with the 5nm finfet tech.  It was previously known that Samsung signed the contract to make the entire batch of Snapdragon 875's. Now they are also taking 750 for mid-range 5G smartphones (value unreported).  In the last 3 months Samsung won over: Qualcomm (750 with 8nm & 875 with 5nm)  NVIDIA (RTX 3080/3090 with 8nm)  IBM (Power 10 with 7nm)  and Google and Cisco (products unreported).
935,>so why is it useful for a statistician to learn it?  Because that's where the industry jobs are. Data science has become a subset of software engineering in many many companies with a digital product or service. That's the reality of the state of the industry.
936,Fortunately I had an auto shop class in high school  which was pretty neat.   It may not be 'extracurricular' in the sense you're looking for  but I hung around the shop I used to get my car serviced at. Owned by a chainsmoking older guy most would find grouchy  he had the tips and tricks that you only gain from experience  and made things that used to confuse me simple. Super nice guy who loved what he did.
937,Pretty much any desktop hard drive will do the job.  Your motherboard has an M.2 port and many SATA ports.  You could put an [M.2 SSD](https://www.newegg.com/western-digital-blue-sn550-nvme-1tb/p/N82E16820250135) in place assuming you don't already have one.  It would be extremely fast when compared to a mechanical hard drive.    A SATA port could run a [SATA SSD](https://www.newegg.com/western-digital-blue-1tb/p/N82E16820250088) and that would still be very fast when compared to a mechanical hard drive.    [Or you could just replace the old SATA III hard drive with a new SATA III hard drive.](https://www.newegg.com/blue-wd10ezex-1tb/p/N82E16822236339)
938,Being theatrically trained  I am naturally inclined to RPGs and I use role playing in my personal life.   Give yourself permission to play and relax...but the only way you do that is to understand your character and their motives...and then commit to the character and build a dynamic character with vivid past  present and future. I could probably send you links if anyone is interested.
939,I don’t know why people are telling you to be nice and call or make an appointment online  you need to go there and demand. It’s not like a door handle the gets frozen shut in the winter like mine. Yours is a legitimate safety issue that’s dangerous
940,Look  all I'm doing is stating it's a sequel  because it is. I will fight people over that.  But that's all.  (well okay I'll also fight people over blindly trusting Ryukishi about what he said  but that's more because blind faith isn't great and that has burned people before)
941,John Lamm and Patrick Hong (who took the photos of John Lamm in that article) kept me entertained and dreaming throughout my childhood (my dad could not afford to get me a car  but subscribed to R&T for me)  Will be greatly missed
942,This feels like a cross between Wise Man's Grandchild and Ascendance of a Bookworm with a small dash of The 8th Son.   It's great. It's not pretending to be some exceptional but I think I'll enjoy it immensely for what it is.
943,I would never by an MSI product again.  I have rx580 and since I bought I had black screens. I sent it back to the store and contacted MSI as well. Both reported no faults or assistance. So I dismantled the card and found one of the pads on the memory wasn't square. I remounted and has been fine since. Will always avoid now.
944,Thinking of changing careers from Financial Analysis and Research to Data Science. I’m currently taking a Data Science and Machine Learning course on Udemy but I’m considering going to community college and getting a Computer Science certificate. I’m not sure if going to community college would be the best use of the time since there are a lot of courses on Udemy  coursera  etc. If anyone has made the transition from Finance or Accounting to Data Science id like to know your story. Thank you!
945,Still  one has to wonder  why not just make things simple and design a 160-bit memory controller in the first place? How much can they possibly save by doing it this way instead? Clearly hitting that 300$ pricepoint required quite a few sacrifices  but still.   Another possibility is that the 128-bit MC was locked in early  before they settled on this final memory config. Since they're already doing a two-tier memory system  that gives them quite a lot of flexibility with regards to the total memory capacity. Perhaps a 12GB version would have been just as easily doable  but they settled on 10 as the minimum viable amount?
946,"That video only shows the Tutorial area  which is a lot lighter than the rest of the game.  Demon's Souls is not playable on an i5-4460 by any means. However  it is Playable on an 4770K/4790K  but that's only low end by today's standards (Intel 10th gen with i3 = Quad-core  i5 = Hexa-core and i7 = Octa-core).   Basically  any CPU with only 4 threads will suffer from thread starvation. A decent 4C/8T is enough for a stable 30 FPS experience.  >  Patent that allows the PS5's APU to switch to a PS1/PS2/PS3 ""state"" to run the games.  That patent means nothing but for some reason a lot of people parroted it at the time without even checking it out. It simply mentions techniques to spoof the CPUID of another CPU  which by itself means absolutely nothing. If it's useful for anything  it's for PS4 backwards compatibility  but if you want to emulate PS1/PS2/PS3  CPUID won't come into play for anything.  PS1 and PS2 emulation already exists in several consoles. PSP and PS3 have PS1 emulators  PS3 and PS4 have PS2 emulators. PS3 has a PSP emulator. The PlayStation classics on PSN use emulators. Sony simply decided to sell the games again instead of allowing playing old discs from the disc drive."
947,Natsume Yuujinchou - 5 seasons? Mostly episodic and somewhat slice of life  but there are dramatic story arcs and recurring characters. Sweet or bittersweet at times  but always heartfelt.   Aria - The mother of all slice-of-life. About female gondoliers in a fantasy setting similar to Venice. Very warm and laidback.   Silver Spoon - About student life in an agricultural college.   Also  these recommendations have only one season  but they’re worth watching. I recently found Isekai Shokudou very enjoyable (people from a fantasy world enjoying food from a modern restaurant  and customers’ lives intersecting as they visit the restaurant).  Gakuin Babysitters is about high school kids taking care of toddlers in the school’s babysitter club - you’d be hard pressed to find a higher concentration of adorable and moving.
948,I think in general  the quality  depth and level of analytics is improving from all this hype.   I work in a large organisation and over the last 5 years  junior analyst roles now require Python/R/SQL skills. Senior analysts should be able to run simple regression and clustering models and translate insights into Tableau/PowerBI dashboards. Analytics managers then take it to stakeholders with PowerPoint and essentially project manage various initiatives with experiment design and statistical evaluation.   My title is data scientist - I review  tune and advise teams on their modelling  so pretty much like a consultant. A lot of my day to day is solutionising - sitting with internal “clients”  usually analytics teams to design models  pipelines and process improvements to get them ahead.   My role is to essentially lift their game - e.g. if it’s prediction  help them design global best practice LSTM models with pipelines to scale (ETL and predictions on petabytes per hour). I design  build and write out all the code needed  again focussing on best practice - so making sure Git processes are well set up  people use Jira and Confluence properly etc   and after 6-12 months hand over the fully automated process to the team and IT.   In short - the role isn’t going anywhere. There’s always money to be made  processes to optimise and stuff to sell so in my view  it’s a great time to be in the field. I love competition 🙂
949,Have the progression go both ways.  Yeah  after beating the 1st boss without taking damage some new items start appearing in the dungeon  BUT a new enemy also appears.  Sure  collecting 1000 coins in a single run does unlock coins worth 5x that  BUT some coins that look slightly off are really mimics that attack you.  You managed to find the secret room 25 times and that unlocked a secret floor with cool rewards? Aight  but that floor is much harder than the floor you get to it from.
950,I pressed X to doubt that the eBay account Starlit Partner (ID: starlit\_partner) is what MSI claimed in their statement as carrying '*excess inventory and refurbished items and would not be given newly released products such as the Geforce RTX 30 series GPU*'.  I thought I'd take a look at their account to see how big their operation is  as I had the impression it would be a few cards here and there  open box returns  refurbs etc. I'd only seen specific mention of 4x RTX 3080 cards as observed by [*u/Rugged\_as\_fuck*](https://new.reddit.com/user/Rugged_as_fuck).  As they've deleted all of their eBay listings I've done a deep dive on their feedback to determine that it appears to be a large (multi-million $) retail outlet for solely MSI products. Can't have been an easy decision to wipe their listings when this much money is involved - they've sold 15k items in the last 12 months alone.  MSI's further claim that '*Starlit Partner is an individual sales subsidiary working under MSI*' may be accurate *per se* but I don't think it really matters as **Starlit Partner shares the exact same City of Industry CA address as MSI Computer Corp** ([us.msi.com/about/contact-us-select](https://us.msi.com/about/contact-us-select))  as evidenced by their website ([http://starlitpartner.com/App/StoreFront/CustomerService.aspx](http://starlitpartner.com/App/StoreFront/CustomerService.aspx)) and Amazon seller info ([https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A8AFHGL03OEF2](https://www.amazon.com/sp?seller=A8AFHGL03OEF2)). **They're in the same building.** Side note: MSI Computer Corp (MSI's US company) shares the same board members as Micro-Star Intl Co Ltd and several other regional MSI companies. This isn't a rogue third party  disgruntled employee  scammer masquerading as MSI etc.  For the eBay account  it was created on Jun-22-2017 in the US and has a feedback score of 5 053 (5 219 feedback received as seller). There are some pertinent salty comments made by Starlit Partner on buyer's negative feedback:  * ***New item ships directly from MFG*** *as advertised.* * ***Item shipped by MSI US (New Item) Warehouse. Used items in different warehouse.***  So they claim new items and all of the listings I've looked at (hundreds) are listed as new.  Sales of items *with feedback left by buyer* is $1 041 631. However  this hides the scale of the operation  as Starlit Partner has left 22 752 feedback for buyers (i.e. items sold). I'm going to assume that as a company they are likely to diligently provide feedback so this number will be somewhat accurate. Their 22k feedback left does not show prices but if we scale up linearly it's \~$4 500 000 (since June 2017).  So to point of contention  graphics cards. Out of the 22k feedback left for buyers by Starlit Partner  5 440 were for GPUs:  * **29 RTX 30 series cards** (i.e. RTX 3080 & 3090) * 1 433 RTX 20 series cards (879 RTX 2070 or better  299 2080 or better) * 3 978 GTX series cards (452 GTX 1070 or better  226 GTX 1080 or better)
951,The Ridgeline - the vehicle that is a better choice for 95% of pickup truck buyers  but they don't buy it because they want the pickup truck image.  It is essentially what minivans are to family crossovers.
952,When I bought my first car many years ago 48 month loan was standard  60 was for very expensive cars. I couldn't imagine going into debt for 8 years on car that will depreciate to nothing while paying interest  insurance  and maintenance.  Sounds like a good way to turn $100 00 to $0.  Just my two cents.
953,Do you need to learn how the algorithm works to use it? No  as you said there are plenty of packages that already implement it for you. Now  by not understanding the intricacies of the algorithm you are bound to misused it. A good example of that was the facial recognition software. All companies were only implementing the algorithm that came out of academic papers without properly testing in real world scenarios  the users were using without understanding what the threshold was and how the algorithm might be biased. Without the proper knowledge it is impossible for someone fully acknowledge the shortcoming of one's method over another  or even adapting one method to better suit your task.  I think we all like to think that we should automate everything that we can  and I do this myself. However  not all problems from data science are the same. Every domain has its own little details that might make some algorithms useless  others biased and some usefull. Yeah we can implement an algorithm (IA or not) to deal with that  but how much are you willing to wait to others implement (and might do it wrong) just because you didnt bother to learn the math behind it?
954,Ok so im gonna try to explain my issue as well as i can. So first off my computer is pretty old i have a AMD-FX-770K processor  8gigs of RAM and my graphics card is i think a AMD Radeon R9 290. Even though its old been working fine for the last like 2 years but them from out of nowhere it seems my computer started doing this thing when for example when i watch youtube  the screen will just freeze and audio will go as normal for a couple seconds before it freezes as well and starts making a weird buzzing noise. Sometimes this will carry on for only a few seconds but most of the time i'll need to restart the computer. It usually happens once or twice a day. Ive tried updating my graphics card and processor multiple times and updating the whole damn OS (Windows 10) aswell. I've even looked inside the case to see if i can spot anything but i see nothing. Basically ive tried a lot but have had no luck. I really need some help here so i'd really appreiciate it. Thanks in advance!
955,The 2.7 is a real bitch for cooling system problems  and that’s coming from an FCA tech that’s owned several cars with a 2.7.   First of all  make sure you have the right coolant. It should be mopar 5-year or Zerex G05. Nothing else is compatible and will cause coolant sludge.  Secondly  make sure you’ve bled it correctly. Get the engine warm and crack the bleeder screw on the water inlet  let it drip until all the air bubbles stop coming out.  Next  did the thermostat get installed with the jiggle pin on the top side?  I’ve personally installed it wrong on accident before and it makes it overheat.  Is the expansion tank cap holding pressure?  If it’s not it can prevent the thermostat from opening at the correct temperature and make it overheat.  And lastly  is the new water pump aftermarket or Mopar?  I’ve never had good luck with aftermarket chain-driven water pumps. The weep hole is above the AC compressor.
956,If I could find a better resolution picture  [SLA Industries CS1] (https://resources.nobleknight.com/Catalog/Images/240/240/0/1/0/NFG505.jpg) has a pretty decent cover. But the imagery for anything involving SLA tends to be over the top nightmare stuff.
957,"About 40 years ago  someone at one of the car mags asked a Mercedes-Benz engineer why it was possible to get a tilt/telescope steering wheel in just about any American or Japanese luxury car (""luxury"" being a relative term for US sold Japanese cars at the time) but not in a Benz. The answer given by the engineer is that Benz had done extensive research on the proper steering wheel angle and they weren't going to let customers mess with that.   For years  cupholders in German cars were inadequate for the kinds of containers Americans wanted to put in them. Because  in Germany  you don't drink and drive  not even soft drinks.   The cars are designed differently for different audiences. The Japanese manufacturers (and  now  the Koreans) were much more willing to listen to American dealers and customers to make what Americans wanted to buy. They're also really good at adding low-cost high-visibility items to cars to make them seem really current. One of the first cars sold in the U.S. with a headlamp that was not a 2 or 4 light sealed beam system was ... Nissan. First car with a digital dash -- Japanese.   Relatively cheap things to add. But throwing in lots of little things like that make a car seem like a bargain. And they're more likely to impress most buyers than electrocoated zinc alloy steel panels or disc brakes all the way around."
958,"Here is what I suggest  in no particular order:  * Some philosophical studies. The writing of Undertale is driven by a certain philosophy of ethics and meditations on it - the scenario and characters derive from that  not the other way around. Yours may be similar  it may be different  but in general  you want to write games around the exploration of a basic idea or principle  because anything less structured will have trouble being finished. While doing this look at other games you like and ask: ""What's the principle being studied here?"" Sometimes it's done in story  other times game mechanics. But it helps to be able to turn on the critical-thinking  analytical part of the mind to achieve conceptual structure. That goes for doing media assets like visuals and audio too! * Some computer science studies. One of the classic 101 Computer Science assignments is to model a deck of 52 playing cards  and use it to simulate a blackjack game. If you can do that - and it is a project that can take a few months to get the necessary understanding for - most gameplay code is within reach. * Completion of tutorials for tools you expect to use. Tools and tutorials build up some technical competence  and so long as you are doing things with computers you will find a need to constantly being doing another tutorial on the latest and greatest tool since they're always changing. But these things never substitute for the conceptual knowledge  they just make it comfortable to get there  and there isn't a need to settle on a ""best"" tool until it becomes a professional requirement. There are many free game engines around  just try doing tutorials with them and see what gaps you need to fill in. * Inexpensive physical tools for audiovisual explorations. I know  your budget is 0. This part is more about setting expectations  since I went through my youth wanting tools that were both expensive and didn't help a lot creatively. Having a sketchbook and pens around is great for visualization  and there are toy keyboards going around $50-100 from Casio and Yamaha that are just fine for playing a short melody - and if you shop for used  you can go even cheaper there  drawing art and composing music is mostly about learning and applying conceptual theories  and more expensive tools in these categories  your screen tablets and professional keyboards and whatnot  are engaging with making it easier to *perform* a certain thing. Outside of that  they're gadgets and don't really do anything to help you communicate the core idea  so they can turn into an awful burden. Simple tools in an organized  ergonomic space(I have been very into binders  lap desks  storage trays and towers  monitor mounts  that kind of thing) and regularly taking classes going forward into your adult life will both do far more than dropping cash on a gadget. What you want is to develop a *space*  that makes you feel energized  able to get to thinking and creating. The specific things that fill the space are not"
959,I noticed in my company that the data scientist are majority whites men. I know many people of color who’d make great data scientist but I hardly see them getting hired.  Who is this the case? How do we make the field more diverse?
960,"> What do you think is the best way today?  There is no single answer. Some players prefer one  some the other. I love the ""git gud"" progression and prefer those games where it gets easier the more you play and understand game mechanics: Spelunky  Streets of Rogue  Isaac  Son of a Witch  etc.  > It does seem like classic Isaac-style roguelites are in decline  I'm not sure there's a decline there. People always liked games with progression more. You can go into reviews and see year-old comments about lack of progress. Those players always wanted to have constant progress. I believe there are more of those players than those who prefer classic progression by player improvement. It's just that developers have figured it out and ""roguelike"" name become a buzzword  so you see more games that match what the market wants.  > What do you think is the best way today?  It depends on your goals. Do you just want to reach the bigger piece of the market and earn more money? Or you have a vision of the game you want to make?  > I've been hearing few people praising us for not having these  but many others complain the game is too hard.   Maybe you can make a mode of the game without permadeath. Let the players play it out  but disable all the achievements or something like that. For example  one of my favorite roguelikes  Rampage Knights  has ""easy mode"" that allows you to restart the last level you reached until you beat it. This ""easy mode"" is great for training and letting you fall in love with the game. Afterwards I beat the game on Normal  Hard and Impossible and unlocked all Steam achievements. If there was no ""easy mode"" I would have less fun getting good.   Players want to have fun and not everyone is skilled. If you want to make everyone happy  you need to have different levels of difficulty.  > Obvious solution would be implementing progression which would make it possible to ""grind"" the win.  I did this in my game  but made it a separate game mode where you cannot unlock all the achievements."
961,The first thing to understand is that starting on a game does not mean you have a full team of devs working 10 hr a day on it.  You start with planning  writers  concept artists  market analysist  and producers figuring what the games is. A game can spend a year or 2 in development before the first lines of code are even written.  Next you make prototypes of game play and conduct market play test to see how players enjoy certain aspect of the game play. Meanwhile Creators are still writing the scripts and creating the characters. The actual programming and level design of game is often requires the least amount of time compared to other aspects.
962,I don't think that SQL access speed would be comparable to RAM. If you don't need the whole data set at once then keep it on the disk and load in manageable chunks.  If you host the SQL server locally then the cache will use the same RAM pool. If you connect over the network then likely your network interface is still slower than local storage.
963,A good rule of thumb is: if your character choices are consistently making the game less fun for other players  then they’re bad character choices.   Talk to your GM  and figure out a way to address this off-table. It is a hard conversation and will vary based on group dynamics. But basically the GM can say  without calling anyone out: “hey  some people have been unhappy with the way the game is going. How can WE make sure everyone is having fun?”  Also a warlock “tank?” Lolololol!
964,This doesn't really answer the question whether 10GB (7.5 - 8GB for titles) will be enough once genuine next-gen games start dropping. Sure you may not currently need 16GB  if you are not running 4K  but it is likely that requirements will expand significantly over this generation and the S may start to look like an ugly cousin to the high-end versions in two to three years. That may be OK. You buy a the cheep S now to enjoy some benefits and upgrade later.  There is still an open question whether S' overall compromises will have a long term effect on the graphical quality of Xbox titles in the long run. Depending on the sales split it could lead to exclusives either being optimised for the S with a few bells and whistles for the X or games being seriously gimped when run on the S. Further it is probably that cross platform title will be designed for the high-end and then gimped for the S.   The console magic has always been the ability for developers to hyper-optimise the game for a single fixed target. This effect really starts to take off mid cycle and reaches a zenith end of cycle. The greater the variation in console capabilities the harder this is.    So in short  the S will most probably be fine for a few years. The open question will be whether 10GB and the other compromises will hurt it and the platform overall in the longer term.
965,I think I've switched to be more interested in the Series S. That console might actually be the better value. 1440p with dedicated scaling to 4K can look damn close to native 4K these days. And if that is the only key difference  in terms of how games look and play on the console (not the lack of a disc drive and the smaller SSD)  I see no reason not to bite.
966,Might want to check with HR to make sure there's no conflicts or restrictions. Just as a warning  it might be too much workload depending on your job/company. I am working full time but still had to finish a few papers after grad school. Working at night and weekends drains you.
967,Did you properly code the new JBE module when it was replaced? My car's previous owner had it replaced but the mechanics didn't program it right so some stuff didn't work  so it sounds like you still have an issue with the junction box.   I would suggest paying someone who specializes in bmw electronics like bimmerbrain to help you trouble shoot. Or you could get the BMW coding software that's floating around the web and look into the actual modules themselves (check vin and vehicle order number  read module specific codes) to ensure its not screwed up.
968,I want to be optimistic but it looks like a Radeon VII with lipstick on  which makes me wonder how similar it'll be in other ways. It's sort of disappointing when Nvidia is cranking out some top rate industrial design.
969,hey guys I'm relatively new to dnd  and i was looking for some help choosing a specific class/race. as a fanatasy lover since a young age  my favorite magic has always been shadow type magic. and i wanted to incorporate that into my new character.   But after scourging the internet for answer  i coudn't find a class/race who would let me live out my dream. I do know that it exist  in the forgotten realm setting  they where those who could use Talfirian magic (which is considered shadow magic).   thank you for you're help/consideration   a hopeful man
970,Traveller and Cepheus Engine meet your specification  I believe.  Traveller has few aliens  and can be played without them  even if you use the Official Traveller Universe. You can create your own subsectors and worlds  and use the setting implied by the rules  fleshed out as you need with your own inventions or adaptations  and none of that has to involve aliens.  While it has been a long time since I’ve looked at GURPS  I believe it has setting books that don’t require aliens  or provides them as an option that can be ignored. Mostly near future-ish hard-ish SF  settings if I recall correctly.
971,This causes me great anguish  exclusivity shouldn’t exist.
972,There are people in 3D rendering who would like to buy a RTX 3090 or several  it is just there isn't enough suppply to go around  If not a paper launch  then almost a cardboard launch: you can see the boxes  but not get the actual product.
973,"SVMs are actually great at what they do  and a couple years back there was a big hoohah about Amazon moving away from NNs back to SVMs.  However  SVMs are bound to fail because their cost isn't in compute time  it's in human time. It takes a lot more time to feature engineer an SVM than a NN but a NN (generally) takes a lot longer to actually fit. As time goes on  and computing power goes up  the NN will fit faster and therefore become a more timewise efficient model to implement compared to SVMs.  This fate is shared by most of the classic pre-NN machine learning algos but some are more resistant as they can ""sort of"" feature engineer (e.g. CART based models). But since NNs generally do the feature engineering for you  it really is only a matter of time until feature engineering becomes a niche subject."
974,I bought an 850 watt CPU hoping it'd last me about 10 years (it has a 10 or 12 year warranty) but linus specifically called out 850 watt psus not being enough for this thing  so I guess mine is already deprecated...
975,Sounds like you and your players enjoy different things. This calls for a conversation outside of the game  figure out some middle ground. For you  maybe pitch a new system that doesn't focus on power scaling (which is pretty much any level-based game).
976,As someone who's 20 Years old rn. I always thought Japanese sports cars were the best for modification and were very capable cars as Supras and Skylines were comparable to F40s back then (videos from BestMotoring). However  muscle cars are huge to me because I would never see one in person in Asia due to regulations. But now in NA  I get to enjoy what wasn't accessible to me a as child.
977,I've had good luck on the the OSR Discord: [https://discord.gg/6vqF25E](https://discord.gg/6vqF25E)   Some OSR games that are quick to pick up and play:     * [Into the Odd](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145536/Into-the-Odd) or [Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) * [Agents of O.D.D.](https://jasontocci.itch.io/agents-of-the-odd) (based on the same rules at ItO/EBL)  * Knave (I like this rules reference: [https://glaucus.itch.io/knave-html](https://glaucus.itch.io/knave-html)) * [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats)   If you want more social conversation with your play (OSR can be focus more on puzzle solving and dungeon crawling) then maybe try the One Shot Club server that organizes oneshots for a bunch of different games each month: [https://discord.gg/Y4DRYdA](https://discord.gg/Y4DRYdA)  You could also try the Powered by the Apocalypse Discord: [https://discord.gg/cGr42y](https://discord.gg/cGr42y)  And the rules might seem intimidating at first but I've had a ton of fun playing Blades in the Dark and I found playgroups here: [https://discord.gg/mfdfdv](https://discord.gg/mfdfdv)  I've joined Discord/Roll20 playgroups/oneshots through all the servers listed above.
978,I think he's a junior developer asking for advice from a more seasoned developer  just like how a college sophomore might try to ask advice from people at Blizzard. Unfortunately he could affect your sales.  Failing from success.
979,>Bones Fab also built Eddie a très cool 1947 Dodge cab-over truck. The truck arrived at Bones Fab already modified with a Ford 6.9-litre diesel and four-speed manual transmission. The crew updated the whole car  including fitting a newer 7.3-litre turbo diesel  ZF five-speed gearbox and a Gear Vendors overdrive out back.  You don't often see a dump truck in a car collection. Most of the time people are collecting the cars they lusted over when they were a teenager  but I guess sometimes you have to get the one you wanted as a toddler.
980,Sorry to hear this dude. It seems like you're on the right track though   building up your portfolio. I don't think it's your history degree since you have the experience. If you're getting auto-rejected  you should review your resume to make sure your resume has keywords from the job postings you're applying to.  Also  networking will give you more leverage  rather than applying to job applications online. Do you have a lot of connections on LinkedIn and have you been asking for referrals?  Don't feel bad  the job market is just really tight right now. A lot of data jobs are being offered remotely which I assume is creating more competition compared to before when a lot of them had geographical requirements. For example in the past if there was a data analyst role in SF that required applicants to be nearby or willing to relocate  that role is now offered remotely which would attract more applicants that are not restricted by location requirements. A very tough time for any job seekers right now.
981,Two months ago I was very distraught and posted asking for advice running games.  I wanted to update those of you who remember that post that I've made an amazing recovery. I've removed a player from my game and haven't suffered any anxiety at all. I've been running a new campaign for the past four weeks and it's been great. I've actually been enjoying it for the first time in a very long time.  The lesson to take away from this I guess is to kick problem players out immediately  especially if your the anxious type like me.
982,1) SWN's GM tools are  as per usual for Kevin Crawford  *excellent* and can be used to support any game.  2) GURPS Transhuman Space is excellent hard sf  3) You can try to get the out of print Firefly (not the older Serenity  *Firefly*) RPG used somewhere  4) Oh  I just realized [Diaspora](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/79933/Diaspora) probably hits all your points best of all  even though I love Scum and Villainy.
983,If she drove a manual for a year it should be possible to get into it again after a few short trips. Try to find some small roads where you have to do a lot of shifting and not much traffic. And maybe practice on some steep hills too.
984,"In the ""old"" Delta Green supplement [Targets of Opportunity](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/111343/Delta-Green-Targets-of-Opportunity?src=also_purchased) you have ""black cod island""  a colony of some sort in Alaska. It contains some rudimentary rules for wilderness survival in cold areas. I saw in another comment you don't know what DG is so think ""X-Files meets Cthulhu"". You have the new version and the old version. They are largely compatible. The book I recommended is for the old version  which runs on the Call of Cthulhu chassis (which means you can ""bolt on"" the rules. You can also (probably) quite easily export it to the new DG ."
985,Say what you want but if is this kind of money was couch cushion money to me I’d buy it and immediately put miles on it (after handling any maintenance needed). Just the feeling of not giving a shit about the collectibility of it and enjoying it instead.  (Also that exporter is known to be sketchy so I wouldn’t be surprised if there was mileage fudging going on.)
986,I got the chance to drive one and I sat in it for 5 minutes trying to figure out how to put it in park or drive  I dont remember which. Also couldnt figure out how to put an Aventador into neutral or Park at one point. Its great when there's like 50 people staring at you. This is why I dont buy nice things.
987,It's extremely rare to find a group of people who are all equally passionate about a project. This is why in the real world people have to pay others to work with them  like a job. I'd recommend if you want to build something and actually complete a polished project that you find a way to shape the game design so that it suits your skillsets well. If you aren't good at art  build a game that doesn't use very many art assets. Get creative and work around your limitations.
988,Most drive manufacturers offer software that will tell you and warn you of drive issues  among other stuff like firmware updates  encryption  etc. Its nice that this is built in  though im sure others will call it bloat.  My question is  is this actually useful to people or just a nice thing to have? Unlike HDD's every SSD ive ever owned has been retired due to increases in speed and cost per gb decreasing fairly substantially over the years. I've never come close to reaching the rated wear on any of them  my current drive is estimated to have over 10 years left based on my use and its rated endurance. To me  I feel like it would be more beneficial to offer an option on Windows 10 setup that will write to the drive  and then verify it  prior to install  to check the amount of bad blocks you might have  indicating a defective drive.
989,Dread is perfect for a horror one shot. There are modifications to Dread that use online Jenga  20 playing cards  or minesweeper to play online. Normally  you use a jenga tower instead of dice. If you succeed on your pull  you control the narrative. If you opt out  the GM controls the narrative. If you knock over the tower  your character dies. The tower creates natural tension. There are youtube videos and free resources available (search Dread RPG). The rule book is worth buying because it goes into how to create tension through hope and fear but you don’t need the rulebook.  https://dreadthegame.wordpress.com/about-dread-the-game/
990,I work part time for a consultancy firm. The work I do for them mostly involves (historical & political) research  basically going through legislative documents. However  they are more and more interested in the possibilities and uses of data science and they've asked me to come up with a presentation to show them how it could be used as a product (data consulting for example).  Here's the tricky part  most of my research (using R) is based on datasets I created myself for my ends. I fear that if I explain it to them from my perspective  I might make it too challenging to understand as I would use a topic none of them is entirely familiar with.   I learned data sciences through courses  (advanced level) books  and some projects that were peer-reviewed which recently led to the publication of an academic article I co-authored with other academics.   How would you tackle this issue? Ideally I'd like to go from the visual aid of plots and graphs to see data from a different angle  to the predictive capabilities of machine learning. I am familiar with the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms. They're not.   The goal here is to make them curious so that I could eventually use  as an example  a dataset they want me to work with.   I do apologize if this is too vague  but I'd be happy to answer any additional questions.   Thank you.
991,"What I absolutely  positively hate is that they use so many fucking ""new"" words. Like...learning a system is hard  but for fucks sake  stick to already established words/slang. But well  that's the only thing I did not like."
992,"And we all have our own stereotypes.  I had an awful experience with a KIA (broke down on the way home from the dealer and was a complete lemon and then the dealer was worse than the terrible car)  So just from my own experience I will never look at a Hyundai/Kia again  Same with GM.  My first car was a Chevy Citation - that did nothing but strand me all over town.  I replaced it with an Old Cutlass that did the same thing.  I've never looked at GM cars again.    A lot that has to with someone feelings towards cars should have the tag ""YMMV"""
993,Thanks a lot for this advice!  May I ask what energy-related data science work you did? I've been in the energy industry for about 8 years and am about to transition into an electricity market-related data science position. I'm curious to hear what others in this niche do and what the career opportunities are like.
994,Definitely depends on the person. The typical route is a software developer because it's a high-demand  high-paying job that shares a lot of skills with game development. Some jobs are easy and some are stressful. A job you can work 9-5 and leave at the office is the way to go. The good part about a well-paying job is that it can also buy you the ability to take a few months off and work full-time on your game if it ever gets to the point where it seems like that would be worthwhile.  The other route  of course  is finding a job in professional game development. You won't have as much time at home  and you can't even think about during work hours  but you'll learn a lot more about game development by actually doing it. Not to mention you'll make contacts and might even decide to work on something with people instead of by yourself  which is always a more productive route.
995,I thought this was a great first episode. It was funny  made me interested in the characters and She is hilarious and put herself in the running for best girl of the season (although Elaina is still best girl this season)
996,"Too many young people (and quite of few of older ones) are uneducated about games  and let big AAA put themselves on pedestals because they supposedly make ""great games"". When they go working for them  they can be exploited because of their passion and their age. From Ubisoft to Rockstar to Epic to Blizzard and the others."
997, How much does GPA matter when you're applying for a MS degree  So I had just graduated and got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering  and I am very interested in the field of data science and machine learning. However  my current GPA is 3.0  I do have a mandatory gap year however -for military service- but I am not sure if my GPA is good enough to apply to a good MS degree specifically in Europe. Has any one had any success of getting into a good MS Data Science program without having a very good GPA.  I am thinking of working on projects during this gap year whether it's simply on Kaggle or maybe could write a paper that I would post on arXiv that's about a project I had worked on.  Just a little background about my education. My university is ranked #176 as per QS global rankings 2021 and #101-150 in the CS department in particular  Thanks
998,"You can create an animation object. Just select the sprites you want (like you did with Shift+select) and press the right mouse button -> go to ""create"" -> animation  You can store this animation object in a Animation type variable  [https://imgur.com/q2ommqz](https://imgur.com/q2ommqz)"
999,Hot take: brand loyalty is one of the biggest cons that companies have pulled on consumers. It prevents you from holding them accountable for things  and blindly being loyal to a brand takes away consumer power because the company can just keep cruising along knowing that they don't need to do better to retain those customers.
1000,Unless you gave him actual code/art etc with license terms or an NDA that he agreed to and is in violation of you can't really do anything.  You gave all that information to him freely.  You would have to prove that you provided that information for specific purposes and that he is violating those purposes.  Even then it depends whether that information is specific enough to be deemed your IP.  Curious  are you as far as actually having official dev kits for consoles or is that still planned in the future?  It is published anywhere yet early access or otherwise?  If he publishes first you might be considered the derivative work.
1001,It does seem like if one isn’t interested in SWE but does like the stat/ML its going to be harder to find a job.   Biotech  where data cannot be collected so easily or where there is always skepticism with automated approaches  is probably a good place to target for core stat/ML. While even in biotech  there are things like Apple Watch or EHR for example  the analyses on this type of stuff won’t be able to constitute evidence for a treatment/product alone. COVID analysis for example is core stat and statistical ML.  Even the definition of ML to me coming from stats vs a SWE is so different. When I think of ML I think of the ISLR/ESLR stuff but an SWE is thinking about the automation and production.
1002,What is the most controversial topic in data science?   Which area of data science is already causing or might cause the most harm for society or individual in near future?  Few examples:  - Losing privacy - tracking of people using facial recognition?  - Personalized recommendations (ability to manipulate people's opinions / votes) - Inability to get rid of biased data and  therefore  incorporating same bias in future model? - Political disinformation using deep fakes?
1003,None of them tbh. They're good intros to the material  but the exercises tend to be hackneyed and not really useful for doing your own learning. The platform makes you feel like you're making progress  but it's not very strong pedagogically.
1004,"Statistics split off some of the applied parts from mathematics a century ago. Computer science split off some more applied parts half a century ago.   As far as data science is concerned  a math degree is as bad as any degree with some math in it (so chemistry  physics  engineering...).  Statistics and computer science are a tougher choice. It depends on what do you want to focus on. Regulated fields demand statistics degrees because you'll need to sign off on things certifying that they are correct. Everywhere else I'd go with computer science.  In my opinion you're trying to get yourself to a level where you can pick a textbook and learn wherever niche information you need. If you spend your entire degree learning about bayesian methods and time series analysis and at your first job you're not doing either  then it was just a waste of time.  Data science is programing though. There isn't a minion to do that work for you. Perhaps for PhD + post-doc + years as a professor ""thinkers"" that are hired as principal data scientists/head of data science and are basically there to tell other people what to do instead of doing it themselves  sure. But as an individual contributor your work is writing code."
1005,Hi all   I’m in a pickle. I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at a large bank in Canada and know I have the technical  theoretical and business acumen to be a successful Data Scientist  however I’m eventually hoping to break into the US market and noticed that there seems to be a dreaded barrier to entry  a Masters degree. I got my current job by networking during an internship. Do you guys think I should go back and get my Masters? Will I be able to bypass this barrier with the more experience I get? Any help/advice answering these questions and any general advice outside of these questions would be much appreciated.
1006,It looks like OP posted an AMP link.

1007,Additionally  you take one of those incredibly fragile xgboost model and try and put it into production for a business use and find that one of its 400 features instantly breaks making it unusable at scale while the parsimonious logit model with a lower auc saves the company money.
1008,Did Sony confirm that PS4 games will be run as a PS4 Pro version unless otherwise specified as running as the PS4 or PS5 version? For example  if I own Uncharted 4 and pop it in my PS5  will it run as the PS4 Pro version? (Unless Sony said it will be upgraded and I missed that)
1009,This is literally a wii game. Not even one of the better ones at that. I really hope this isn’t real or if it is then people don’t buy it and Nintendo learns to that this isn’t okay. Pikmin 3 deluxe was stretching it  now this? A WII GAME? It’s literally like 10 dollars on Wii U virtual console. Alright.
1010,You are talking about the differential scheme  I don't like that one because it can quickly overflow your designated backup drive. I prefer to use the incremental  and set my instances to 10  once every week. After I complete 10 backups  a brand new full backup is created  and the original is deleted.
1011,A logical financial decision from Sony. The company in the dominant market position will make anti-consumer but profitable decisions. Microsoft did so back when they were dominant with the xbox 360 and now Sony are doing it with the PS5. Thankfully MS have a really compelling console this time round which might force Sony's hand with backwards compatibility.
1012,For 75-85% of the market this may be true. Both webmasters and data scientists were/are at the mercy of SAAS built by their colleagues. 85% of businesses can get away with templated solutions  not yet in DS  but when you get 5-10 brilliant webmasters or data scientists and say let’s get a piece of the 85% market share  it happens. Sure you can rake in tons of money in that remaining 15%  but in technology the beast will eat the beast  always has  always will.
1013,Don't try to make it realistic. High fantasy is defined by not being realistic. Infinite food? Sure! Cities in the sky? Of course!  When I worldbuild for high fantasy I get inspired by looking at artwork that conveys a place similar to what I want and try to work from there. Anything that irks you off can be explained away with magic.
1014,"Two thoughts:   ""Right"" is not as absolute a term as you might think. What you're thinking might be right  but not useful. Or not practical. Or too expensive. Or take too long.  Yes  it is entirely possible that what you're suggesting is better in every possible way. It's also possible that you're missing something important that your proposed approach fails to deliver on. I have seen this happen a lot - junior DSs who come up with ""the right"" way to do it... only it doesn't work. Or it doesn't answer the actual question. Or it's going to take more money to build than will be generated as a return.  Again  maybe that's not the case here but you need to entertain the idea that you may be wrong.  In either case  right or wrong  your best approach is to create a short  concise outline of why you oppose their method  and why you think a different method would work better.  If your method is better  you should be able to do this in two paragraphs - one to explain the issues with their method  one to explain the benefits of yours.  You don't need to fully explain how each will work  but just outline the issues at a high level.  Example:  ""The approach the customer is asking for will systematically underestimate the cost to acquire customers. Because of that  implementing this approach on a $100M revenue base could result in unexpected costs of $1-2M.  If we instead model X as Y  we would be able to more accurate estimate the customer acquisition cost  allowing the customer to avoid unexpected losses.""  Put that in an email  and send it to the person leading the project. You can add something to the effect of ""I understand that I may be missing some context  and if that is the case it would be great if we could discuss that so I can have a better understanding of the decision making process""."
1015,Want good wiper blades? Pay more. The end. You car is like a fine woman. If you cheap out on her she will make your life miserable. Just get the rain-x ones and thank yourself later when they actually work well when you need them without streaks or screaming. Plus they last 2+ years compared to the cheap ass ones that fall appart after sitting in the sun for 20 minutes.

1023,Depends on the client. If it's a bigger  older company I'd stick with Word/PDF or an HTML. They don't want a Jupyter notebook that won't work once you take down the server or they can't print. Or they can't open without special software. Make it easy for them is my motto when doing freelance.
1024,"I was running a solo session of my campaign where a character was exploring a highly non-Euclidean environment. As someone who's studied differential geometry and dislikes the usual ""strange angles make you go mad for no reason"" trope  I wanted to design some puzzles that worked within the environment of non-euclidean space and would be accessible to people who didn't know any of the maths. I came up with two puzzles that I thought to post here in case other GMs might find them useful:  1 -- Reversing Forwards:  For those of you with a mathematics background  this puzzle asks the player to exploit the lack of parallel transport on a sphere. The player(s) find themselves in a foggy chamber  or otherwise have their sight distance limited. They are handed a gyroscope (a device which always points in the same direction) which they can carry and which points in some direction and are informed that they need to turn it to face backwards somehow. Maybe they need to fit it into a lock pointing the opposite direction  or if this is a test  are explicitly told they need to return the gyroscope pointing backwards.  The space they occupy is actually the surface of a sphere  though the sphere's curvature is normal curvature of spacetime  and so they do not perceive a change in facing as they walk it. However  when they walk through the void and inevitably return to the starting point from the opposite direction  they will quickly work it out. Then they need to find a way to reverse the facing of the gyroscope using this fact.  The solution is: They walk to the antipodal point (half as long as they need to circumnavigate the space) with the gyroscope in hand  then turn 90 degrees and walk until they return to the origin. This will invert the gyroscope's facing without physically rotating it. Conceptually: Imagine that they first walk in the direction of the gyroscope: On the antipodal point the gyroscope's facing will be rotated 180 degrees from the perspective of the space in which the sphere is embedded. Now as they turn 90 degrees they are perpendicular to the facing of the gyroscope  and as they walk back the gyroscope will not change direction.  2--The Elided Slide:  This puzzle isn't directly based on non-Euclidean geometry  but is the sort of puzzle you might expect to find in a game like Antichamber  and really works best as a solo puzzle. The player finds themselves in an environment where they can only look in the four cardinal directions  either because of tight corridor walls or some other impediment (my player found themselves outside reality and their character's nacent divinity was only enough to sustain minimal 'reality' around them  meaning direction itself was biaxial and quantized)  and they are unable to judge distance  either due to a warping of reality or some other effect. In front of them they see an object of some color. When they step towards it  they reach it immediately  see that it is a wall  and see two other  differently colored "
1025,I've struggled to get into Paradox games in the last few years as I have a lot less time than I'd like.  Is this one easier to pick up?  I know CK is supposed to be one of the more intricate of the games  but it's always the overwhelming UI that turns me to something easy on my one day off.
1026,Marvel's Avengers is a single-player (with co-op) game  right? When I played games in the 90s and 00s and I wanted something in the game I couldn't otherwise get (i.e.  too time consuming  too difficult) I'd just cheat it into the game. Most games supported this by having cheat codes.   Nowadays games like Middle-earth: Shadow of War (which is now microtransaction free) and this hot garbage make cheatcodes essentially cost money  and are probably online-only to ensure that people don't resort to cheating for outfits and other unlocks instead.
1027,Yes. Not only do you have a shot but once you apply you will likely get in. ( assuming decent undergrad  recommendations ).  You do not need a CS to get into a DS program  but it certainly would help  a Lot. I often hear CS or programming is not necessary for DS and you can pick it up  but for me it took significant amount of effort (maybe I have difficulty in thinking like a programmer)  You can self learn most of the stuff via MOOC/YouTube but just because the material is available ‘out there’ doesn’t necessarily mean you will. To test this hypothesis for yourself  take about three months and see how much you can learn using the free resources and see if that mode of learning works for you. ( didn’t work for me ). On the other hand being in a program pushes you to take advantage of the MOoC/YouTube  this channel  medium etc for you to solve your assignment and overall necessary things you still need to learn yourself. But going back to your original question  the only way you will not get in for sure is if you don’t apply.
1028,So yesterday my friend after shutting down his PC unplugged his extension cord where his PC is plugged in the thing is he forgot to switch off his PSU and also forgot to switch off his extension cord when he did the unplug. So he tried plugging it in again(which caused a small spark from the socket) then turned on the PC again and it seems to be doing fine. The thing is he is asking me if there are negative effects that will happen to his PC because of what he did. So question is: is it okay to unplug the PC while the PSU and Extension is still turned on? Thanks

1030,I do not see anyone addressing the real issue  compounding interest. It's not really the interest rate that makes a loan expensive  it's the length.   For example  at \~7% average yearly returns  you could be a millionaire by investing roughly 5k a year from your 20s to 50s.

1032,So we got a gacha that nobody asked for and a moba that nobody asked for. Pokémon games just can’t seem to find their niche. I don’t know why we can’t get some high definition RPG or some kind of plain Pokémon game that doesn’t look like doo doo.  Sword and shield was awful and it’s sad that I have to admit that in the year 2020 when it looked like a PS1 game. I’ll take my downvotes now

1035,">Is the work I'm doing considered to fall under Machine Learning  Engineer responsibilities or am I still in the Software Engineer area?

1036,I'll say something no one has said before. Make sure this isn't a fucking free day of labor that they're exploiting from you.  I've been in several situations that an organization has conducted day-long interviews  which I don't think are good or bad  but after really digging into the specifics of the agenda the organization had planned  I learned in my follow-up questions that they really were just looking for a day of free consulting on a problem they're presently facing and hoped to bring in fresh meat like me to give them the answer and then kick me to the curb.  I'm sure you're a talented and smart individual with a bright future ahead of you. But seriously beware of predatory practices like this. They're extremely common and especially now  no organization is exempt from this. I don't care if they're a non-profit trying to help starving children in Africa or some other stereotypical social good organization or a multi billion company. You pay a professional for their time and skills.  Make sure they're not trying to exploit your talents for free consulting. Even though the job may sound great  if they're willing to abuse you in this covert manner before they've actually extended a job contract to you  what do you think they'll do to you when you're on the inside?  And this question doesn't have to be posed as a big deal. I quite literally  as well as many of my colleagues  outright ask if they're looking to just get free labor from these day-long interviews and exploit my skills. And make sure you ask to confront other employees about this question directly during your interview too. Whether you're just there for a free day of labor.
1037,"Canadian here. Sorry to be blunt  but you will absolutely not get into any grad program whatsoever with that kind of GPA. Not only are the vast majority of seats reserved for citizens  but our country is notoriously harsh when it comes down to pre-requisites.  &#x200B   If you'd like to find graduate programs that will let you in with ridiculously low pre-reqs (i.e.: your classic ""I got into a Stats MSc with Calc I-II-III  LA I and Stats I alongside a sub-3.0 GPA"")  you'd better have a look at US programs. Moreover  graduate studies in Canada are seen as a direct continuity to undergraduate studies  so switching fields between a BSc and MSc is extremely hard."

1040,R is a statistical language. Statistics only go so far in the corporate world. Yes  it’s nice to see data of a particular issue  but in reality having a large amount of visualizations  plots  models  and complex functions really just obfuscates processes instead of streamlining them.   For production level tasks  R is also trash at managing these types of things. Shiny apps and dashboards made in R are incredibly slow. Just today I used one that took 30 minutes to load!!!   It’s python equivalent took less than 10 (but we have to cross reference the two for any discrepancies).   I get that you like R. The first language I learned was R and it opened my eyes to an entire world of programming. I then learned python  followed by HTML  CSS  and JavaScript  and then Swift (I have also dabbled with Lua  Java  and C++). R is just not flexible or adaptable to problems outside of stats and when a person wants a coder  they want someone who can do multiple things. Not just make pretty plots and tell me iris and sertosa are in different groups.  My advice to you though is  apply to a job and tell them how R works better for their specific need. They’ll either hate it or love it.
1041,In my opinion if a company uses SAS most likely its not going to be very interesting work  SAS is very rigid and not a real language and it mostly is meant to do canned procedures  Thats why even as a biostat major I never bothered with it besides when I TAed in health sciences. I was given the code then but when I did have to change a few things like even taking a log transform was more difficult than it had to be

1046,"About a decade ago I had a 9th gen Corolla that started randomly misfiring and stalling when I would come to a stop or try to start it. I took it into the dealership where I bought it  and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. They replaced the spark plugs and fuel injectors  at my cost  and it still kept stalling and failing to start  and I had to pay for all of it. Then they started trying to upsell me on random shit while they still couldn't figure out why my car was broken. The most egregious was the one who tried to tell me I desperately needed to flush my brake system and replace it with new fluid. When I asked him why  he said it's ""very dusty right now and it could get into the braking system"". The car had 30k miles on it  and if there's lots of dust getting into the braking system there's obviously much bigger problems than just replacing the fluid. I basically told him to fuck off and give me my car back.   Three months later  Toyota issued a recall for the ECU on that gen that was causing all the problems I was having. I never got any of that money back. So yea  I would say learn to do the basics on your car (oil changes  filters  etc...) and for everything else  find a nice indie shop. Especially DO NOT take it to a dealership for ANY reason. It's just a massive ripoff and they'll try to upsell you on irrelevant dogshit the whole time. It's fucked."
1047,Same price for same perf? They better have ML supersampling ALA DLSS of comparable quality and performance and comparable ray tracing perf  same for DirectStorage decompression compliance otherwise  sorry AMD not buying it.  I want the best bang for my buck and RT/DirectStorage/MLSS perf/quality is part of the deal even if it guzzles a wee bit more power.
1048,I have seen it done where you already have an ltv model built for your customers. Then you train a regression to *at the time they were unknown* (right before they became customers... You know less about them then... And you predict the ltv value at month 6 (or a specific month after signing up). This is a conditional model that gives project their ltv IF they sign up  so you also need a propensity to become customers aka a conversion model to multiply thst against.
1049,Hello  Everyone.  This is my first reddit post and I am excited to share my hobby!  This is my homebrew adjustment of the Resource Table in the *Advance Judge's Book* (p. 8). Other references are written at the end of the post with links. In addition  I added more Marvel examples and added characters from the City of Heroes/Villains game.  Please  feel free to add any comments  complaints and suggestions. I need your feedback. Thank you.  **Resources Adjustment**: I was thinking about adjusting the Resource Ranks. For example  I don’t like how in the Amazing (AM) rank that it contains “Large corporation  small country \[with examples including:\] Doctor Doom…Mandarin…A.I.M.” I disagree (*Advanced Judge's Book*  p. 8).  It should be placed in the AM column: Large corporation and that’s it.  I would move “small country” under Monstrous (MN)  instead. My reasoning is that it has “billionaire playboy” in that category (*Advanced Judges Book*  p. 8). In addition  I observed that the king of Swaziland is a billionaire and leader of a small  Southern African nation (Skolnik  2008). It is logical that Doctor Doom  Mandarin  Black Panther and Advanced Idea Mechanics would be MN.  I would adjust the Resource chart as follows:  · *Amazing* \[AM\]: Small Country’s Military  Large Corporation  Multi-millionaire \[International Non-Profit Organizations  (100+ Member) Paragon City Supergroup  Midnight Club/Squad\]  · *Monstrous* \[MN\]: Small Country  Billionaire \[AIM  Black Panther  Doctor Doom  Mandarin  Stark or Stane International  Lord Nemesis  Lord Recluse\]  · *Unearthly* \[UN\]: Large Country’s Military or Government Branch  Multi-national For-Profit Corporation  Trillionaire \[Roxxon  Crey  former SHIELD  The Family  Maggia\]  · *Shift-X* \[SX\]: Large Country  Multiple-Country Union  Multi-trillionaire \[United States  former Soviet Union  China  European Union  NATO\]  · *Shift-Y* \[SY\]: Nano  Micro or Pocket Dimension \[DJ Zero of Pocket D\]  · *Shift-Z* \[SZ\]: Planet or Earth-Sized Dimension  Interplanetary or Interdimensional Organization \[Urthona (*MU5*  pp. 238-239)  Dream Queen (*MU5*  pp. 58-59)  SWORD  Vanguard  Rikti\]  · *Class 1000* \[C1\]: Small Collection of Pocket Dimensions  Intergalactic Empire \[Odin  Zeus  Mephisto  Shi’ar  Kree  Skrull  Rularuu  Mot\]  · *Class 3000* \[C3\]: Multi-dimensional Territory  Space-god \[Dormammu  Celestials  Galactus\]  · *Class 5000* \[C5\]: Multiverse Entity \[Eternity  Infinity or Death\]  &#x200B   **References**  *Advanced Marvel Super Heroes Judge's Book*.[https://classicmarvelforever.com/cms/advanced-game-and-modules.html](https://classicmarvelforever.com/cms/advanced-game-and-modules.html)  *MU5.

1050,I fail to make time to work on the campaign.  I fail to schedule sessions.  I fail to craft encounters that are more than smash and grabs.  I fail to create a coherent story.  I fail at engaging my players with what story elements there are.  I fail at giving out loot.  I'm a late response  but I thought it may be cathartic to write it down.  It wasn't really.
1051,For complex architectures  a lot of time is invested in writing C/C++ models that emulate the functionality and performance/power characteristics of a design. Being significantly higher level than transistors and RTL models carries an accuracy penalty with regarding to predicting final chip performance/power  but greatly reduces development time required to explore and experiment with architectural/microarchitectural changes.

1054,I’ll be honest. I’m very upset with the gameplay  movement stiffness and enemy models. IDK  maybe it’s just me. The beta felt lackluster (gameplay-wise) and all the bugs were just infuriating. I was looking forward to this game since it was announced and I gotta say.. This was my first pre-order return  ever.
1055,Good thing your laptop still has warranty for it  as then the supplier will have it checked by a professional. However I highly **recommend backing up your important files** as a just incase  as they may simply replace the entire hard drive.   Based on the noise location and your description  it sounds like your HDD is faulty here. As loading things will feel slow (including desktop start menu  options etc)   I can only assume either something is misaligned inside from a drop or the hard drive is faulty since the beginning.
1056,this is a really  really *huge* question  to which i can only really reply ”this is a really huge question” and refer you to [transmeta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta)  which was a company that made a cpu similar to what you are thinking.   by ”huge” i mean that i am chickening out of writing a maximum size post or two and citing all of my sources then *defending* the damn thing  because i don't think i can simplify this adequately without a lot of background :)   but for a quick and dirty  you could look to a software emulator like qemu to get your feet wet on this one...
1057,Honestly a lot of BL manga falls under yaoi which isn't suitable for tv obviously. Some (non-fetishy) BL *have* been adapted  such as Given  Doukyuusei  and Umibe no Étranger  but this has been more of a recent trend.
1058,My company also offers some really great educational stipends. I have my MS already. I will be going for an MBA next. I'm not particularly interested in an MBA in general but it opens up some more doors. I think that would add more strength to a resume than a 2nd MS.
1059,We launched a new product. Every new migration from the old product to new product appeared to take longer than the last. It was an anecdotal observation from myself and our salesman that a week later was confirmed when we had overnight migrations shitting down the throat of our servers into business hours the next day  still migrating data.  The dashboard built to monitor performance of migrations showed green across the board  but it obviously was wrong.  I bugged our devs for access to the log files and ran a regression on various steps and their timestamps. It showed that the increase in time was due to 1 step of the process.  I was able to determine that for every record processed through that step  a fraction of a fraction of a second was added to the next record to be processed that was an order of magnitude greater than the increased time for all other record types.   The dashboard it turns out had been truncating timestamps instead of rounding before doing all of its math to display the results  so the marginal increase in time per record had gone undetected. That was fixed  and the problem  plus one or two other smaller ones became evident.  It turned out that during development they had switched the method used to append new records to a table for all 100+ record types to something more efficient that's above my head  but they missed this one.  We went from unable to onboard customers to wiping our backlog out in a week. It's one of the achievements I'm most proud of as a guy who was hired just for marketing.
1060,Your judgement is correct - follow the fiction. If it doesn't seem to make sense in the story for them to be the same entity  they're not.  As the game goes on and relations are established between the two - say  the village regularly supplies grain and recruits to the guild  or the guild establishes a safehouse or a black site in the village   or even if other factions just start perceiving the two as one - the fiction would suggest that maybe they should be merged.  It's OK for wildly disparate things to be folded into a single company. My last game the group was in charge of a complicated web of noble families  business interests  dependent clients  villages  etc. My guiding principle was the fiction  and how much the resources of one could be marshalled with or for the others in the story.
1061,"Hi Reddit   Finally  I've become a grown-up and recently just graduated from my university.  I come from an MSc in business intelligence and have about one year of experience with study jobs  that is mostly focused on ""front-end business intelligence"". Basically   that means making dashboarding and working with already ready data.  So  now I just hit an interview with Amazon and I'm pretty impressed that they wanna interview with me even though I lack experience  and therefore I'm here to ask for help.  As you can see in the [Job Posting](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/1236454/business-intelligence-analyst-6-month-contract) I pretty much need two years experience and be proficient in SQL. Well  to anyone's information I'm quite confident in everything than SQL. I know for sure  that this job requires a lot of technical skills within data extraction  manipulation etc for business requirements.  And.. I'm pretty sucky in SQL having only had in school and made some basic query. The interview is on Wednesday  and I don't know if I should just try it? They send an e-mail  that said they will have live coding test on me but I basically am scared because I'm terrible at this part.  What's ur suggestion? I have two days to maybe run a data camp for fundamentals of SQL  but I'm unsure if that's enough to consider myself worthy for this position?  Any comments will be appreciated thanks!"
1062,The whole battle for buying up IP and timed exclusives is why I don't like console now. I get why Xbox has to acquire whatever IP they can. If they didn't  then Sony 100% would and they'd lose this arms race  but make no mistake it's just a big ol' business war and I don't feel like being a part of it.   It sucks because this IP war is going to cost gamers their collective experience in the end.
1063,Do we know the same thing for Pascal/Turing? As I noted before I am keenly interested in the GT 1030 and GTX 1050 Ti successors which are pretty strictly watt bound and 25% would be nice  the 1650 was 20%-ish over the 1050 Ti together we would be reaching the 1060 at 75W which is not bad at all.
1064,Would you allow an artificer to make a Mech? Also what’s the wildest thing you’ve allowed one to make? I am asking as a DM and I would to allow fun stuff but I don’t want to take it too far. We are playing with DnD 5e guidelines.
1065,   Hi. I need your guidance.  I have a veterinary background and practiced animal clinic for more than 10 years. Three years ago I started shifting my career and I'm finishing my master's in computer science. My thesis is about web development but I would love to join the biology and computers and I thought about the data scientist path since I have biology skills that can help interpreting results. Since I don't want to repeat the same mistakes after finishing vet school I want to ask you the following:  \- how is like to work as a data scientist? what you like and don't like?  \- I would love to hear advice from senior data scientists to juniors...so I can skip a few mistakes?  \- when you graduate from a master you know a bit of everything but since I need to get deeper in this field and gain more knowledge ... I was thinking about datacamp as a source for data scientists...what sources you recommend?  Thank you so much for your guidance and responses. I really appreciate your feedback. \^\^
1066,I see you mentioned Tech Chap. Did you see his latest video of his 3080 and CX that came out yesterday? Looks like he didn't have any issues with his CX. Not sure if this will help or related at all but I found the video pretty informative  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TAnGjT6_N0
1067,I am sorry for your lose. If you haven't seen it already I would suggest either food wars or K-on. Both of them are peak fun when it comes to anime. Especially in food wars. Once you watch 2 episodes  you will be hooked. Somehow they make the event of cooking the most incredibly griping hype thing you have ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat for quite a lot of it. Warning though  make sure you eat before you watch it. As it will make you incredibly hungry.
1068,Erina Nakiri has to be the cooking goat. This girl is not on a prodigy with an inherent god-given skill to aid her in doing so. But she also has the work ethic to match it. An insane combo that can be inspirational to watch.
1069,Datadog might be accepting interns. Go to the virtual job fair they have with powertofly in [https://powertofly.com/career/virtual-job-fair/](https://powertofly.com/career/virtual-job-fair/) and ask human resources directly.
1070,I have a 2012 Honda Civic EX Coupe 1.8 L and a 2011 Toyota Camry LE 2.5 L the civic is at 155 000 miles and the Camry is ay 146 000 miles. Aside from what the maintenance notice the cars give me   is there any maintenance things I should be looking out for like timing chain  spark plugs  water pump etc? Or should I not worry and just listen to what the cars give me notice for?
1071,Very excited to see what AMD has done. They really focused on improving from Zen 2 and are releasing Nov 5th right after showcasing the GPUs.   Th eprice increase is $50 across the board it seems but they are starting with the X processors. By Spring I can see more being released at lower price points which will face off against Intel launch.   AMD used to be considered the budget brand that you get if you couldn't afford Intel. Now they have shown they have the better performance (wait for benchmarks tho) and aren't gonna be the budget bois anymore. But they say they offer best performance per dollar.   Eitherway i think this is a very strong launch of Zen 3 and we will see how it goes Nov 5.
1072,What are some important things to look for in selecting and applying for a masters degree? For context  I currently have a bachelors degree in economics and finance and have completed several MOOCs in preparation.
1073,Dude I feel the same way. Just started on coursera a few months ago and I enjoy it so much  it’s almost like a reward to sit and go through the labs. Almost done with the IBM DS certificate. What are you on?
1074,I'm curious where Indiana  specifically Indianapolis  would land. We've had a bit of a boom in the tech industry in the past 10 years  and SalesForce now has their second biggest office in the country here. We also have a lot of hospitals and health clinics in the downtown area  so I imagine data science jobs in the health care field will continue to grow here.   Cost of living is ridiculously cheap  especially housing. Rent for a decent 1 BR apartment only 20 minutes from downtown is about $650  and you can find good houses in decent neighborhoods for under $200K.   I'm curious of the long term affects of the pandemic on  white collar jobs and organizations a decade from now. As more organizations are learning they can still run effective business with a remote workforce  there will likely be a big move to scale back on physical space. The commercial real estate industry is going to take a huge hit. For organizations that do still want/need physical space  maybe they would consider moving out a costly area (Silicon Valley) for a cheaper area like Indy or another similar sized midwest city (Cincinnati  Columbus  Cleveland  Pittsburgh).
1075,"I play 5e  but I wish other systems were just as popular. It kills me when I see posts asking ""can anyone recommend how to adapt (sci fi  drama  the expanse  vampire  Aliens  super heroes  Detectives  etc) into 5e? I just think  THOSE GENRES ALL HAVE GAMES ALREADY MADE FOR THEM  STOP TRYING TO FIT THEM INTO 5E.  Look at other systems  which IMHO  work better for those genres. One of my favorite systems is AGE  which was designed for fantasy  sci fi  super hero  modern age  all kinds of settings.  And there are other systems that have abilities for different settings. Stars without number  chronicle  PBtA  d20  many others I can't remember right now. You don't have to force everything into 5e.  edit: I went on the engine rant  and forgot to make my point: Every system may have it flaws or bugs  but take it in stride as if you were playing Goat Simulator. Use the system as a guideline (as every DM manual will tell you)  adjust on the fly  and sometimes the bugs make the game fun! Hopefully your group will accept your ruling and keep the fun going..."
1076,D20 Modern was basically BTLC. It will be hard to find the books tho. GURPS can do it flawlessly (there are even references to the movie in the core book). Savage Worlds is also a good candidate IF you are planning on a one-shot. Also take a look at Cinematic Unisystem (Buffy  Angel  Evil Dead) as it is a very fast and simple system that can easily handle the action from that movie.  I would ho against the collective and stay away from Feng Shui 2. I’ve played it way more than one should and it is a hot mess - poorly tested  not balanced at all  and filled with last-minute changes that can easily beak the game. But the main issue is that it is slow  very very very slow. It was a common complain during testing.
1077,I heard that VW Group also owns shares in Rimac  so selling Bugatti to them would be a win-win situation. Bugatti started as a PR stunt and a huge money pit  I still can't imagine they make much money from it anyway. Even if they do  it's just compensating for the huge losses of the Veyron.
1078,In addition to things that are specifically about GMing  you might want to watch some live recordings of professional storytellers on YouTube to learn better ways of making descriptions come alive.  I was a semi-pro storyteller for more than a decade  and use a lot of the skills I developed along the way when I GM.
1079,So  am I getting it right that you try to predict if the delivery will be on time based on the 35 variables you have for each row?  The decision if you should use a time series model basically depends on whether you expect that previous  time shifted  features do affect future OTD scores. E.g. if there are seasonal or trend components involved.   Could you give us some more details? 1. What does the input look like? 2. What does the output look like?
1080,If you want your players to be vault dwellers that just leave their vault for the first time  I'd just give them some of the usual vault-tec propaganda and leave the rest for them to explore.  [(Some images from google)](https://www.google.com/search?q=vault+tec+propaganda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X)
1081,I use spritesheets  a few particle systems and one 3D animated object.  The problem is: when 2D animations are being played (walking  jumping  punching etc) the game frezes for 0.5 - 2 seconds when any 2D animation is playing for the first time. I thing it happens when animation Unity transfers animation to the RAM. Once all animations was used one time -- everything works fine without any freezing.  So  how to solve that? How to move animations to the RAM before full game started? May there is a special option in Unity that I don't know.  Thank you! (:
1082,By the way  none of the RTX 3000 cards use POSCAP  POSCAP are very specific line of Panasonic SMD capacitors  it's not a general name for any SMDs.  Anyway I highly recommend everyone interested in this subject to check out Buildzoid take on that (AHOC on YT)
1083,Hi all   Hope everyone’s staying safe & healthy!  I’m new to the data science and have been working on a few projects at work. I’ve always struggled with the best or efficient way to capture notes from a project I’m working on. Currently  I take notes like I’m writing a paper for a class and then use that to build a ppt for presentation. But I’m curious how do you guys take notes on projects you’re working on? For instance  do you guys note every result you get when you run a model? Or do you guys only note the best results?  Thanks!
1084,Until we see 6GHz i don't think I am interested in WiFi 6. Plenty of improvements that don't seem to produce massively tangible performance benefits where what we really need is less contention and short range high bandwidth frequencies alongside the longer and less capable 5 and 2.4 bands.
1085,Me and my group managed a 20 hour session.  I count it as one session  but 12 hours in I ran out of ideas for the game and another GM took over with a different game that ran for the remaining 8 hours.
1086,Hi all   I want to extract trend  seasonality and residuals from a time series  preferably with statsmodel's [seasonal decompose](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html)  I have a dataset containing data from weekdays only  since there is no activity in the weekend. In the seasonal decompose I have to add the period of the series as a parameter. If I am correct  I can find trends/'seasonal' weekday effects by setting period to 5.  However  I also want to check monthly/yearly effects. What is the best way to go about this? I see two options:  * period=20 (monthly) and period=260 (yearly). However  not every month or year has the same amount of workdays. So this will not line up perfectly... * Add weekends to the dataset with a value of 0  and then do period=30/31 (months) and period=365 (years). However  in this case  months can have 28 29 30 or 31 days  so even after adjusting for missing weekend days I expect monthly seasonal effects to not line up perfectly.  I did try both approaches  and honestly  both approaches give decent results on first sight... so I am curious what would be the best approach in this case.  Thanks a lot in advance!
1087,"Perfectly fine  I run some 17x8 RPF1 for track over my 18x8.5 SSRs and as long as the calipers still fit and you're not fouling anything you should be fine. My SSRs are running 235/40/18 and RPF1s 235/45/17. You'll get some better ride comfort depending on the tyre and a little less steering feel if the sidewall is shorter. The car is noticeably quicker off the line with around 1.5kg less per corner. If you change the diameter just remember your overall gearing will be affected as well - you can use this to your advantage if you're trying to optimise for a certain track etc.   245 on an 8"" might be pushing it  just make sure the tyre you're going for isn't wider than normal to begin with. I would recommend 235 for an 8"" instead  and it's usually a hell of a lot cheaper."
1088,I need a new action anime with intense fight scenes and preferably a main character that has a fuck you attitude   Here’s what I’ve seen already https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Lennnny&view=tile&status=7
1089,Everybody is all worried about the name of this product and I'm hard as diamonds about this being the first product to ship with 16Gbps 16Gb GDDR6.   Also kinda neat that Nvidia prioritized VRAM capacity so much that they dropped down to GDDR6 to gain access to 16Gb memory. I'm betting clocks will be low enough that the lower 3080-esque bandwidth won't be that big of a deal though.
1090,I get really frustrated when the NPC that I worked for hours on to be a challenging adversary is easily overcome by the party and some random thing I never thought they would do they instantly jump to.
1091,i have about 10 000 hours in D&D and i want to branch out.  i have call of cthulhu  shadowrun 5th edition and Kids on bikes.   i am having a hard time finding a fantasy RPG replacement for D&D.    i would love some suggestions.  bonus points if it is on Foundry VTT and if the combat system is fairly strategic.   thanks!.  Edit:  i didn't expect so many replies and some of you guys gave detailed explanations as well.  i am impressed by so many of your responses.     i decided to jump into Shadow of the Demon Lord.   this post was perfect for me.  SotDL was not even on my radar till now.   Once again thanks to everyone for the help.
1092,3rd paragraph. Personally I think you need to stop giving 2 F's and let people be. It doesn't matter if you have social media accounts or not. People like me will look  stare  and comment to our self's. Also a Challenger is not that special. Its a very common car by FCA for 10+ years now. If someone comments nice car they just reply thanks. If they ask if it has a HEMI then reply it has a V6. Yeah you'll probably get shit about it but that's how it does.   I had a older guy in his 40s pulling up in an old E-class benz at while I was filling up my car at the gas station. I have a SS badge on my 2016 Malibu (as a joke and to troll Vette/Camaro owners rofl) then proceed to ask if my car was an actual Malibu SS. Of coarse its not and he was cool about it told me GM used to make the true SS sedan from 2014-2017\~ then I drove off. No harm  no foul.
1093,I think Mass Combat. I believe I found a good way of integrating Roleplay and Strategy together. At least my group seems to enjoy it.  And beside that  probably pretending. Pretending that I over-simulate the whole world and everything ties back into one-another somehow.
1094,I’ve found that with European cars  German cars in particular as that’s what I’ve owned  as long as you maintain them (and by maintain them I mean do preventive maintenance and stay ahead of it)  you won’t have a lot of problems.  I’ve owned a 2008 Audi A  a 2012 VW GLI (wifes car)  a 2014 VW Touareg (still own it)  a 2014 Porsche Cayman S (still own it) and a 2016 Macan Turbo (also still own).  The Porsche’s have had pretty much no issues.  I’ve spent $500 in maintenance on the Cayman in 15k miles and 2.5 years.  The Macan has 1 major service ($1000) in the 18 months I’ve owned it and that’s it.  It did have a headlight repair under warranty for some super minor crazing of the plastic.  The 2008 Audi I owned for 6 years and 90k miles.  Outside of routine maintenance  the only Issues it had were a few fuses/switches and sensors going bad.  All of those were fixed under warranty or very cheap to repair during routine service.    The VWs had the biggest problems.  The Touareg had a water pump replaced 3 times due them breaking/leaking.  All under warranty but still extremely annoying.  The GLI had a timing chain cover replacement for around $400.  That’s pretty much it.  Ironically  I also owned a 2002 Acura RSX Type S and a 2015 WRX.  The WRX was by far and away the worst.  I owned it for 14 months  bought it brand new  and had it in the shop 5 different times with various check engine lights.  The fit and finish on that car was also pure trash.  The RSX has a bunch of issues with the interior.  The seats got replaced twice due to the stitching falling apart.  The steering wheel got replaced due to the stitching coming apart.  The leather on both the replaced seats and steering wheel completely eroded after a few years.  The shocks on the hatch were replaced 3 times.  The rotors warped.  I could go on  and on.  I loved this car  but  the fit and finish was nowhere near what you’d find on a German car.    Moral of the story is take care of them.  Don’t take them to shitty mechanics and make sure to do the preventive maintenance.  You do that  and your European car will be fine.
1095,Sorry to hear about that experience. That sounds sucky.  Why did they get the idea that you weren't available? When you cancelled the session 0 did you tell them it was because of their lack of response and excitement?
1096,Either way Amazon and Sony don’t give a shit as long as they get paid. They should give their customers money back if they can’t deliver for the time those customers paid for.
1097,"Couldn't agree more with this post.  My go to shop is a 3 bay family run garage.  They always give me a discount (even though I've never asked  and I've actually offered to pay full price  but they won't hear of it lol).  They also never fix anything that doesn't need fixing  and they can always fit me in at a moment's notice.     I brought my Honda Pilot to the dealer for the Takada airbag recall and was told my power steering is ""leaking badly and needs to be fixed urgently"".  I brought it to my shop told them the situation.  After inspection one of the lines was ""sweating a little oil"".  ""Just keep an eye on the oil level and if it gets bad  bring it back in"".  That was 3 years ago.  Honda wanted to replace the whole steering gear for $2000.  Fuck big shops."
1098,Industry leaders actually draw the line between data analytics and AI in two ways. The first is whether or not deep learning is involved. If so  they brag about using AI. The other bar they'll use it whether or not they are doing computer vision or NLP. If so  they brag about their use of AI.  Actual practitioners who understand how the technologies work will just debate endlessly  as you are seeing in this thread already.
1099,"Code Geass is my usual rec for something like this  but other than that I guess I'd spitball Logh  Fate/Zero and Jojo Part 2.  Logh has 2 protagonists on opposite sides  one pro-democracy and rule of law and the other is an authoritarian. Both of them are super smart while at the same time feeling human. They don't feel like fantasy wish-fulfilment because both have things that drag them down such as politics.  Jojo Part 2 is my favorite Jojo part. If you want a ""fun"" take on being smart  Joseph Joestar is your guy. Jojo Season 1 starts off with a classy gentleman white knight protagonist but that part is only 9 episodes.  Fate/Zero MC is basically a professional hitman. A pretty surgical kind of guy  so he's perfect for a battle royale style format."
1100,If you go into mechanical engineering in college  your university might offer Formula/Baja SAE and some internal combustion engine/car dynamics classes. Also maybe some abroad programs to intern at companies in Europe where you could work at a car manufacturer or supplier.
1101,I realise these have probably been in the works a long time and intentionally have been held out for post whatever AMD release. But don’t be upset with your 3080 purchase. They’re still crazy powerful cards and you don’t NEED the difference between say a 3080 & 3080ti. Can’t stop us from sure as hell wanting it.
1102,San Francisco is your problem.  You and a bunch of other more qualified people in that and just about every area of the country have been laid off due to covid.   It's not that you're doing anything wrong  it's just a bad market.     Consider the option to relocate or look for work outside of San Fran.  Most places are defaulting to remote work anyways.
1103,Hello   I am currently working in accounts payable but have been teaching myself SQL/Python/HTML through CodeCademy pro. I've burned through all available courses there  and have been speaking with the data analyst manager at my company. I did a project for him but its clear that I need a deeper understanding of data science. CodeCademy gave me the tools to build a house  but I don't know how to put all of the materials together with those tools. I have a background in stats from college. I've been researching datascience boot camps as a way to solidify what I've already learned  as well as for the career/networking opportunities. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? From my research  FlatIron  Galvanize and metis all seem promising.
1104,When Zen 1 launched over 3 and half years ago with the top 8 core 16 thread at $500  people are really calling the $550 12 core 24 thread some ridiculous out of the blue price jump that's hard to swallow?
1105,This is somewhat related to data science as it involves Airflow  but I wanted to get some opinions on what people use Airflow for. It seems like a perfect tool to trigger and visualize scripts and DevOps automation tasks- what are some thoughts on this? If not Airflow  is there any other workflow management tool suited to this?
1106,"There's exactly one situation where saying ""die"" is better than ""dee."" That's when calling out damage of spell effects.  ""The Light strikes you  dealing Four Dee Eight damage"" (starts picking up dice)  ""48 damage?!""  ""Sorry  four die eights"""
1107,"[Here is a cross section of a typical modern tire.](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/tiredtread-12827453985934-phpapp02/95/tired-tread-2-728.jpg?cb=1282727541)  Notice how all of the reinforcement goes into the area where the rubber meets the road? There is none of that in the sidewall. Continuing to ""beach"" the tires against the curb places stresses on the sidewalls in ways they were not designed to handle. This increases the chances of a [bubble](https://tyres.cardekho.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tyre-sidewall-bubbles.png) and or [blowout](https://www.powerwheels.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tire-Blowout.jpg)."
1108,That was my last job.  It was at a company that had a lot of geospatial data  but it was all very poor quality so we couldn't do more advanced statistics on it.  I did a ton of Tableau dashboarding  which sucked.  Then I got really good at working with GIS data  which was cool even though it wasn't what I wanted to do long term.  That included learning the OpenGIS standard and the sf and tidycensus packages in R.  From there  I made a lot of proofs of concept using a mix of internal data and free external data.  For example  I was able to map lng/lat coordinates to buildings in the Microsoft Building Footprints dataset to look at whether our activity was clustered near residential or commercial areas.  I also looked at demographics by mapping activity to census tracts.
1109,Regarding the upgrades  to incorporate your ideas  maybe have each upgrade have 2 choices. So infantry's first upgrade you choose either heavy armour or speed. Then second upgrade is heavy weapon vs fast shooting one. So  player can build a heavy armour guy that shoots fast or fast infantry with heavy gun... Each option adding or subtracting speed/damage/armour/health etc.
1110,"Here's a paper trying to analyze the RTX implementation. They may do some ray grouping?

1111,I think the economic reality here is that most aspiring data scientists (and young professionals in general) aren't trying to break into a specific industry.  They're trying to get a job  any job  in any industry.      Realistically  the most bang for your buck isn't to learn the nuances of every single industry you've applied in the last two weeks.  It's to sharpen your tech skills so that you make it past the resume screen.  Or it's to work whatever network you have to get referrals into whichever companies are hiring at the moment.  THEN you can spend an hour brushing up on the two or three companies that have actually bothered to move you to the hiring manager call.  THEN once you actually start the job you can really take a look at the specific challenges in that domain.
1112,Obviously if everything is held constant pick the senior role.  Where I'm from there are senior DS roles at small companies that make 30% less than regular DS roles at companies like Twitter  and roughly half of the senior DS roles of the latter companies.  In the end  it's just a title. Evaluate the job based on the impact you can create  brand name and reputation  learning opportunities etc
1113,I really liked it but it was like a 5/10 if we’re being honest. It wasn’t anything special technically wise but it was unashamedly itself and gave what it promised. I still would say it was one of my favourites of the season despite the rating  it was a ‘good bad anime’.
1114,> For a long time  CPU[']s have had a big division between the front end ISA [...]  and the microarchitecture that actually [for] does the low level math.  Really?!   I think you're greatly over-estimating the division between the two.  If you're going by the commonly held misconception that modern x86 CPUs are somehow RISC under the hood  take a look at this [7 series RISC-V block diagram](https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sifive-7-series-block-diagram.png) and notice how it also has a front-end decoder.

1116,"Sounds like a tedious job and I don't envy you. There is something called a ""clamp meter"" that can measure DC current inductively  so you don't have to disconnect individual wires from their harness connectors to put your multimeter in-line.  Googling them gives me the impression that there's a huge range in capability with those things  so get one that suits your needs. You'll need mA resolution but you likely don't need something that can handle 600A."

1118,Today's AI are mostly based on machine learning: genetic algorithms  neural networks etc... These AI are based on a numerical approach: the programmer define numerical inputs and numerical outputs and the machine learning is used to create the relation between input and output through an equation whose coefficient are generated by learning.  In the first golden age of AI in 50' to early 70' the number crunching capability were very limited and the approach was a lot more based on logic. At that time AI were based on graph walking and self writing code. Lisp family language have been extensively used for this purpose because the syntax of lisp have the same structure as its basic type (the list). Hence  it was easy to generate new code.  That period of research have been the base for great achievements  I think DeepBlue and Watson were part of those efforts. It also laid the basis for symbolic computation software and theorem prover that are still extensively used today.  I don't know about games that used that approach but it may have been done. Honestly  I don't know what could be done  but if you can define inputs and a clear purpose  you may achieve nice things.   There are extensive resources on the topic from the academic world  but it may be hard to get into because academic people write for their peers (by definition  journals are peer reviewed).  This [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#The_golden_years_1956%E2%80%931974) article is very rich and may help having a first taste of things  have a look.

1122,I agree with most of the other commenters. But one other point is given you know python  I think the jump from python to Matlab is easier than the jump to R. Therefore if you suddenly needed to use Matlab for some reason at work I think you'd work it out fine without taking a course.

1124,With like half of the top 10 shows being one episode ahead of this thread  it's gonna be real weird talking about them here this season  it was already confusing enough with just Railgun last season.  **Jujutsu Kaisen** already has some *solid* charm  art/animation  music  and some instantly likeable characters. It's also got enough time with 24 episodes  so as long as the story is good  this looks like a recipe for success.   **Tonikaku Kawaii** had a *much* bigger debut than I expected and I couldn't be happier about it. It's just so good to see this adorable series come to life in anime form!  **Higurashi** bamboozled everyone by not being just a simple remake  thus I'm surprised *and* glad that it didn't suffer from that and instead pulled an unusual second week karma raise. That said  I don't know how this will turn out but I'm hyped for some new content!  Oh would you look at that? It's Onii-sama time. **Mahouka** returns with a new ~~girl~~ harem member and Onii-sama ^(kinda) fills the void that Anos left. While I'm neither a major Mahouka fan nor do I remember much from season 1  I enjoyed the movie enough to continue with season 2  since 8bit did that as well  so hopefully this turns out good.  **Danmachi** returns with what feels like might be the most interesting arc yet. And if it's going where I feel like it's going  this is going to be good. Also cute monster girl daughter  always a win!  **Elaina** had...what I consider one of the absolute best first episodes of the year  needless to say  the best debut of the season for me. *Beautiful* art and characters. I can't wait to see more of this show.
1125,The udemy course is good but I think it's too basic. I also did one by Ben Tristam (unity 2d platformer it was I think). They do have a lot of stuff but almost 80% of it is super basic in the sense I felt like it was made for people with 0 idea of programming. So I don't think you would necessarily find that useful. They do have multiple courses so try to check the syllabus first.   The best way to learn unity is just by doing stuff. Make a new project. Do something in it. Anything. Made a 3d model. Try to make it move. Errors? Make a new project. Try something else.   I think at first it will be hard  then you will get the hang of it but then after sometime you will be facing a bunch of issues and you don't know what to do and feel like giving up but if you keep going forward you'll break and barrier and then unity will be a walk in the park. You would then be at a level where you can do what you want with the engine.  Atleast this was how I felt.  Sorry for the rant.
1126,"Yes. _Most_ mobile games by sheer numbers of what's being released are small and quick. But most mobile games being played are quite a bit larger than that. People put a couple hours at most into a hypercasual title before moving on  but games from Galaxy of Heroes to Candy Crush have people with *thousands* of hours played in them. That's what most people are actually playing on their phones.  In terms of story-driven games  there've been quite a few dating back to Surviving High School. Look at games like Lifeline  companies like Choice of Games  or platforms like Episode or Choices for a place to start. Just be aware that what made these games work was size of operation  IP  and marketing. ""A lot of players"" in mobile doesn't come for free."
1127,"I'm running a Rise of Tiamat campaign but I heavily modify the story and all NPC's. Party was up in the Sea of Moving Ice and was captured by a tribe of people that were forced into servitude by a dragon. The party's paladin challenged the tribe's champion to a non-lethal duel of honor. If the paladin wins  the group is released  their presence hidden from the dragon. If he loses  they are turned over to the dragon. The champion is also the tribe's dragon liaison of sorts and the only reason the dragon hasn't wiped out their pitiful existence.  The duel ensues. It was a very tense battle and I like to add flair to fights like this so most rolls are accompanied by a narrative. The paladin was one hit from being knocked out and decides to unsheathe and use his magical sword (the group was pre-warned that any magical intervention including items was forbidden and considered taboo to the tribe and would be met with deadly force. The party was grossly outnumbered.)  At great protest from the party  the paladin makes an attack roll. He scores a nat20 and crits. The sword he's wielding is the 9 Lives Stealer. The champion makes a con save and fails. For those who don't know  as the name implies  this sword tears the soul out of any living creature on a nat20 and failed con save if they are below 100 health when they roll.  Their party bursts into a ruckus. Some are laughing like crazy other are like WTF I told you that would happen! It was a few minutes of them going back and forth before I brought them all back in. I described in gruesome detail the outcome which went something like:  ""You plant you rear foot firmly into the ground and lunge forward  slashing diagonally. The champion prepares to dodge  recognizing your footing. His speed and reflexes are lightning fast and he leaps backwards in time to evade the strike. When you bring your sword down  there's a pale white shockwave that continues in the shape of your slash.  It impacts the champion and travels straight through him. When it comes out the back  a translucent copy of the champion is attached. The shockwave and copy fade to nothing as if being slowly erased from existence. The last thing that can be seen is the image reaching out as if trying to desperately make its way back to its body. The champion falls to his knees  his cheek twitches in futility and then his lifeless husk collapses to the ground.""  That battle led to some amazing encounters over the next few sessions.  I used this example of the nat20 because of how anticipated that roll was. Our entire table was silent waiting for the paladin to roll that die."
1128,Aftermath  closely followed by 1E Twilight:2000  followed by Universe. Aftermath still seems very opaque to me  even though I like the setting/concept. T:2K is actually completely fine and good to play once you figure it all out (ran it for 5 or 6 years in the 1980s)  and Universe has some nice world generation stuff.
1129,I've said this before but the best organized setting book out there currently is Ultraviolet Grasslands by Luka Rejec. The biggest advantage is that as a pointcrawl  it's been designed so you only need to read a location when you get there.
1130,>it makes the players feel like they've got control over the world  Aye  and that's just what makes it unsuitable for some players and groups.  Sounds great for groups that like author-stance play or systems based in handing off narrative authority  but not so good for players or groups who want the feeling of exploring a world that already existed independently before they showed up.
1131,Just bought the car two weeks ago. I plan on keeping up with the recommended maintenance schedule. I’ve already put a ceramic wax  3M headlamp polish  a leather cleaner  ArmorAll on the inside dash  seat covers for my kids  RainX  and a back to black on all the exterior black plastic. Anything else I should do as far as paint protection or fluids/maintenance?
1132,I've found that Rock Auto is 98% of the time always cheaper for buying auto parts than anywhere else in Canada. Even with the shipping costs and taxes  it's still cheaper buying from them than any local Canadian store.  And that's pretty sad.
1133,I have a use case where I wrote a few notebooks that other developers run  mostly for debugging and reporting. We were keeping them in github  but running them produced a bunch of changes we didn't care about that would sometimes get committed and pollute diffs.   I just uploaded the latest versions to a shared google drive and told everyone to run them through colab. So far that's working well. I don't have to help everyone with jupyter environments anymore  and the meaningless changes don't get saved anymore. It's only been a couple weeks  but it's working well so far.
1134,bitches gonna bitch.  They are crunching a lot of expectations into making their release date. It's not like death marches are new in the gaming industry  and think of the squealing if they pushed the date back.
1135,I'm ready for him to destroy this stupid thing. I hate this trim. It's like Toyota is giving all the Corolla ricers *more* reason to customize their dumbass Corollas. If you're gonna try to compete with the SI or the Veloster at least change your engine and get a DCT or something.   I drive a Civic Sport  which kinda competes with this  but I feel like the difference is  Honda didn't try to make it look like a full out race car  it's just a simple appearance and handling package and does not cost you 30k.
1136,I just read the blog and it just says updates from PlayStation studios I swear to fucking god if we don’t get the price I’m just gonna go and buy the next Xbox won’t even care if PS5 is $50  Sony is trying to take advantage of their consumer’s patience which eats shit.
1137,The program shown in the video displaying the code is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for Java called [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/). The application the person wrote is linked in the video description.  You would need a light amount of coding knowledge to modify the code to run on your computer. Certain directories are hard-coded so you would need to change those to match your environment. Then you can compile the code to run it.
1138,Did the impossible happen? ASUS made a TUF product that isn't fucking shit?   That's pretty cool  definitely keeping my eyes on a TUF 3080  local retails expect stock next week  hope I can pick one up.
1139,When I was in high school  I wanted to make video games. Then I learned that crunch was a part of the industry. In fact  it’s a part of a lot of industries. On one hand  I hate that people are passionate about this job and have to crunch. At the same time... that’s the job.   I drive a truck and crunch happens here  too. 15 hour days at work. Sometimes I lose a Saturday. But if there’s a deadline  what’re you gonna do? You took the job. I think that’s just reality.   Honestly  I care less and less when these stories come out about.... normal business functions.
1140,This is a shockingly good take on a controversial (why?) topic. Excel is a great hacksaw for data and easy to pass around with users. Sure  it’s terrible that people use it as a database and they mess up formulas and they make manual errors with data entry. But if you know those vulnerabilities exist and you use Excel for the right jobs and avoid using it for the wrong jobs  then it’s a fantastic tool.
1141,WJ (1999-2004 Grand Cherokee) is probably the best kept secret out three.  1) availability: they made 1.4M of them. Look around next time you’re driving - they’re everywhere.  2) cheap  3) reliable - yes they have a lot of small issues  but many on the road have 200K+ on them  4) off road: solid front and rear axles with center locking transfer case and 4lo
1142,"Hard to answer. I grew up in a ""Ford family"" and thought getting a used one as my first car was a no brainer.  Goddamn was I wrong/right at the same time. 98 Exploder. Learned to fix a lot of different shit but man did it hurt my young wallet.  Moved to a 07 Accord 6-6 coupe which gave me a trouble free 70k on top of its 132k exactly when I bought it  on top of being the car I learned manual on  and heard from every enthusiast I talked to about what a sleeper it is and how amazing the gearbox was. I felt spoiled lol.   I've had 3 Hondas since and I have no real reason to look elsewhere. I know the product well and I know Hondas will always have an enormous aftermarket for their performance vehicles.  If I ever wanted a 600+hp monster (aside from a modded NSX) then I'd look at other brands because I know that isnt Honda's deal."
1143,It doesn't matter if the 8000 hz polling rate does not bring any improvement... It's insanely easy to hit that rate with modern electronic components anyway so why not.   8000 hz is a joke.   At that rate  a $0.3 20mhz 8-bit microcontroller trying to handle processing data from a 12x12 sensor will get 17 clock cycles per sensor pixel.  The algos for turning sensor data into motion vectors probably need a bit more than that but processing data from a 30x30 sensor is probably within reach of a $1 to $2 32-bit entry level microcontroller like a 80mhz esp8266 or 64mhz stm32.
1144,"Yeah: shut up about how worthless you are. DO NOT do that. You are only worthless because you believe you're worthless.   People tend to say ""wow  you must be really smart!"" when I tell them I taught myself to read  write  and program BASIC on my Commodore 64 before I reached Kindergarten with no adult assistance  but I'm not any smarter than anyone else.  I just **wanted it real bad.**   If you just want to make a game because you think it may be fun  either don't bother or try finding a really simple engine  because it won't be worth it to waste your time learning everything you would need to learn to make it.  However  if you love games and you want the true power of a God... to create worlds for others instead of just mucking about in worlds other people made for you... then just type ""how the hell do people make games"" (not that exact phrase  though...) into Google and get those gains.  I make 3D games on a laptop with a Celeron processor that I bought for 150 bucks at Wal Mart twelve years ago. It crashes if a dog barks across the street. It's dumb.  But I don't give up.  If you want to make games  don't give up  and don't ever  ever  **EVER** call yourself worthless again."
1145,D6 is a good system for what I believe you want. OpenD6 is cheap (core books in PDF for less than 2 dollar here: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20448 ) and they have space  fantasy  action and a couple other genre rule books as well. D6 was the engine for the original star wars game and it is a blast to play.

1147,Make a website. Put your best work in a demo reel video  about 2 minutes long. Watch ReelTalk on twitch. Follow sound designers on twitter. Look for jobs on Hitmarker  r/gameDevClassifieds  TIGsource forum and other places.  Try to figure out your weaknesses and work on improving those skills.  Good luck!
1148,The most noticeable thing jumping between my miata and a generic FWD car is the torsen rearend.  And then for normal driving I only notice it when making a 90 degree turn from a side street to a main street and the road is dirty/gravely.  Not the right wording really but I can feel the torsen freaking out and swapping power back and forth as the wheels slip on the gravel or whatever.  For normal driving on normal roads wet or dry no.
1149,Not really surprising. I'm one of the few people who was actually really excited for this car but can't really think of what niche it is supposed to satisfy.  It's like the German equivalent to the Charger/Challenger dichotomy. The 2 door one looks cool  but why would I pay around the same money for a 2 door that weighs as much as the 4 door with an identical power train?  It's not really helped by the fact that unlike the Charger/Challenger twins  the M8 is rather understated and only has that wow factor in real life when you can appreciate the massive stance. Buying a Challenger over a Charger makes sense to people who want that classic muscle car aesthetic. The M8/M5 look pretty similar  in that both are a mixture of refinement/aggressive lines - neither really jumps out at you as being substantially different.   They should have made it flashier looking  lighter  more aggressive - anything to distinguish it from the M5 which is already extremely dominant in the sector of 'Ridiculously heavy/luxurious car that somehow still performs well'   I'm still *very* impressed that BMW can build ~4500lb cars that run a 3.0... but I don't really know what the target market is for a 4500lb two door that runs 3.0 lol
1150,"You wouldn't have asked this long post if things were as simple as just ""drop her and everything will be better""  so I'm going to buck the trend of the comments here  and come in with a different answer.  Perhaps you're expecting her to play *your way*.  In college I ran a very large D&D game with our social group of some ten people (plus an eleventh who cooked us all dinner but didn't play  awesome guy).  That probably seems like an impossibly large group for a practical game  made further impossible by the fact that many were new players (and some were more there for the social aspect) ...  but it wasn't: we all had a blast  and people still remember the campaign fondly many years later.  This was before everyone was on smart phones  but even so we had people socializing  eating  and even *knitting*  all during play.  One player's way of having fun in our social setting was to:  * actively play some of the time * knit and chat a lot of the time * occasionally get interrupted with ""hey it's your turn  what do you want to do"" * get suggestions on what to do by more active players (eg. ""heal Bob he's dying"")  and then go back to knitting/chatting  It worked!  Everyone at the table was engaged to some degree  but different people had different levels of engagement  different ways of playing.  We had success by letting everyone play in a way that was fun for them.  Perhaps  if you can find a way to play that your player has fun with (and I'm leaving that deliberately vague for a reason  since knitting and chatting and playing may not be the solution for your player: it could mean changing things IRL  finding missions for them in-game  etc.) ... they'll start enjoying the game.  And *that* seems like the root of the issue (the ""sabotage"" just sounds like a symptom): games should be fun for all participants. If someone isn't having fun  you want to figure out how they can have fun (without ruining the fun of others)."
1151,>I did a DS bootcamp and didn't cover any math at all  which was surprising  So no coverage of even basics like mean  median  StDev  percentiles...? Or was it assumed you already knew this before going in? There are such courses that have that listed as a prerequisite.
1152,I recently discovered [Bad Obssession Motorsport](https://www.youtube.com/c/BadObsessionMotorsport/videos). They are funny  detailed as heck  seem to know what they are doing and obsessively... detailed.  They are in the midst of transplanting a the drivetrain of a turbo 4wd Toyota Celica into a Mini. they've been at it for 7 years  and each episode is 20-30 minutes long.  My favorite moments are when some previously unexplained construction detail suddenly plays a major role in a newly completed feature  and amazingly  everything fits to the mm.
1153,Increasingly we are seeing news articles (e.g. https://voiceofaction.org/collapse-of-civilisation-is-the-most-likely-outcome-top-climate-scientists/) discussing how we are about to face major destabilizing effects on society from global warming. Let’s put aside any discussions about the accuracy of these models and the scale of the impact on society and for the purposes of this post agree that there will  at the very least  be effects  and that these effects are growing with time.  Now  management asks you the regular questions: forecast sales for next year  recommend how much product to keep in stock  propose where to establish stores  predict supply line delays  etc. In a “normal world”  we would assume business as usual and not bother about freak tropical storms impacting our East Asian manufacturing  pandemics decimating demand  or blizzards disrupting our supply lines. But if these events are becoming more frequent  ignoring them no longer remains good practice.  Another side of this topic is that climate scientists argue the “cost of doing nothing” is far larger than the cost of reforming society to become more sustainable. By leaving out the effects of climate change  we  the forecasters  are effectively predicting that the cost to our business of doing nothing is zero. Thus  our lobbying departments will lobby against any reform that would negatively impact our results under past conditions.  How can we as professionals go about to include the probability of extreme events and gradual effects of climate change in our models and forecasts? What new types of projects should we be proposing  e.g. around resilience? What can we as data scientists do to highlight the “cost of doing nothing”?
1154,yes this anime is very heartbreaking but i thought the ending was perfectly bittersweet. the MC got out of a dark place because there were people who helped him. this anime is truly special  you can’t miss it
1155,I’ve enjoyed what I played so far. It feels distinctly it’s own game rather than D:OS 3. The dice rolling thing is cool  the combat feels at least slightly more fluid  and the dialogue scenes are solidly built  at least so far.  The only problem I have is that I’m having frame rate issues being on a GTX 1080 and 7700k. I know I’m overdue for an upgrade  but I drop below 30 often playing this. I probably need to tweak it a lot more  but so far it’s the only major problem I’ve had. I’m sure as I play more I’ll see more of them  but I don’t regret buying it so far.
1156,I’m looking at getting a Mac for music production and I thought that a Mac mini would be good since I already have a surface pro  a keyboard and a monitor. However  the MacBook Pro I circled is only 200$ more than the Mac mini. But idk how much better the processor is on the mini so let me know if you know!
1157,Conan is the crunchiest game I ever tried to create a character in.  I never got around to playing the game  though - I didn't even complete the character until I found a website online that takes you through it and lets you download the resulting character sheet.
1158,I was originally interested for the mecha during its announcement. Turns out the mecha wasn't the main focus  the little fights it had were flashy but thats about it. Would've been nice to see more of the large scale fights like the one episode where the city was breached.

1160,[Here's](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-RTL-VHDL-Verilog/dp/0470531088/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=digital+design+with+rtl+design%2C+verilog+and+vhdl&qid=1600369739&sprefix=digital+design&sr=8-3) another one I'd recommend. It was the book for my digital design course  I found it very understandable and well put together
1161,Hello all  currently doing a digital circuits course in university. CPUs and GPUs in modern times have billions of transistors. How is something on that scale improved or even iterated on? I understand being able to tweak individual adders or multiplexers to increase efficiency  but how is such a thing possible for people to do on a chip that has billions of them? Do they use supercomputers to simulate all the transistors  or is there some level of similarity which is then scaled up to billions?

1163,No certifications I am afraid  but I think it's better to create a story without a dashboard.  Good options to do so are [Plod](https://plod.app/#/) (analytics focused  make a story in minutes) or [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) (explaining your ML models: takes a bit more time but cool).
1164,I've been on Jalopnik since  08 I think   quit for a few months   came back but it's looking about time to pull the lever. I'll miss Torch a little but he turns up on YouTube from time to time and that'll be plenty of him.
1165,"Do not share work-related SQL code. It is extremely difficult to anonymize effectively  and even if you think you've scrubbed it  the structure of queries themselves has the potential to reveal IP.  IMO  the value of seeing an active repo is less about inspecting someone's code and more about getting a feel for their understanding of basic devops concepts. Especially if there's also some sort of coding assessment in the interview process.  Sure  code samples can be helpful  but what's more valuable is to see github repos with more than 2 or 3 commits that have resulted in a PR to a larger project or show some evidence of code review or whatever. That's why ""github repo"" is probably the wrong metric (at least for me) and ""has contributed to a larger project"" is way more highly valued (even if that contribution was tiny)."
1166,Is mileage such a big problem?  So there is is this Toyota Prius with 280 000 miles and there is 2008 Honda Fit with 260 000. I spent a lot of money on my first car and totaled it. 3 500 down the drain it took almost a yeah and a half to save up that much. I’m scared of buying another expensive car because again it’s going to take me a while to save up. If I just wanted a car to get me to work would these cars be okay considering the mileage. I am a female and riding the bus home late at night is completely terrifying so I hope you can understand my situation. I turn 18 in 6 months so I only need a car that will last at least that long  because then I could just finance instead of paying out of pocket. Should I go for it or not?
1167,I like Pokémon and mobas so I’ll give it a try since I have nothing to lose.  To all the people complaining- fucking relax. If you don’t like mobas or Pokemon this game probably isn’t for you  and that is ok.   Also mtx are to be expected in f2p games. As long as they are just skins/clothing that’s perfectly fine.
1168,I prep with some basic stats and plot hooks for things that could potentially happen  but just try to wing everything else. Nothing ever goes according to plan and the players will shoot the one person in the face that you absolutely needed them to keep alive. My other preparation is to mostly absorb the setting and/or time period. When I run 1920's Lovecraft  I get heavy into the music. I'm running a Delta Green game set in the 1960's and I've been inundating myself with 60's music to prep for that.
1169,- Read the manga (aka stick to the god damn source material). - Focus on character development arcs. - Side-characters  when well fleshed-out  make your world feel richer and more immersive. - The protagonist should have goals/interests that he completes along the way other than that one big goal at the end.
1170,It varies from player to player. Some players aren't all that invested in being mechanically powerful  while for others it's the only reason to play the game.  >  How powerful a player's character is seems to matter much less than how involved their character is with the story.  For a lot of people  you're bang on. It's just that in some campaigns  and for some systems  the two can track. More powerful characters wind up with more screen time  or can resolve problems in ways that cut other characters out of the limelight.  So there is no one right answer. But it's helpful to not allow things to become too unbalanced. Once things get to a point where people are grumbling  it may be too late. But as long as you can keep the spotlight moving from character to character  it should work. But do watch out for those players who see the question in purely mechanical terms and make sure that they don't fall very far behind  if at all.

1172,This is really good news for the Ultrabook segment  where performance/corecount matter less vs efficiency/optimization.  Perfect for day-to-day mobile warriors and a bit of light gaming.   We are finally seeing some healthy competition beyond the 14nm+++++++ era.

1174,It's really up to you how it works. That's the beauty of programming. If you can think of a logical way a feature is supposed to behave  it can usually be implemented with code. Code really just is logic written down.   The way you ask the question makes me think that you never worked inside a game engine before though ... which means: Everything will be hard. Doing the kind of modular system you possibly have in mind will be complex to create. Balancing it will be hard aswell.
1175,Hello people of DRP ! Sorry to bother whoever is reading this and for be more than one question  but i planning to start a PNP campaign on discord and i need to ask some questions.

1177,A good PSU can last 10 years (some companies even warranty them for that amount of time).      Who knows whats going to happen with power consumption in the future  but it does seem to be trending up.      A solid 750-850watt PSU seems the way to go for new builds at the minute as it'll give total piece of mind for the most power hungry CPUs/GPUs and if the current trend continues  should provide the next few future builds with what you need.
1178,Hello   I'm a guy who is currently pursuing his engineering in a technical field somewhat unrelated to game development. I realized that whatever I'm currently pursuing is something I really do not want to become my future  because from when i was a kid  i was(an am still) interested in game development and now I think i should change my career goals to match this. Even when i was doing a course in C++  python i preferred coding simple games such as pac-man rather than coding something else.  I then spoke to a couple of friends who are in this field  they told me that a degree in game design isn't really that necessary and told me to start working on my creative skills in the remaining time i have left to complete my under grad. I took their advice and started learning to work on unity and unreal engines.  Now after i master my skills in learning such engines and creating a few games  if i go to a company for an interview  how will the employer/Interviewer get convinced by someone who has no prior certification on any design related skill that they have acquired? And as someone who has absolutely no idea about how things work in this field  what are other steps i can take to strengthen my career when i shift into this field?

1180,">""One of our older players is more interested in the narrative  in her words ""\[GM\] tells us a story  sometimes he tells me what to roll and I just roll it"".   That's not narrative play.  That's passive play."
1181,I was shocked I got approved for a newer mustang GT. I've could've been driving away in a V8 heated/cool seats monster but I said no. Car was 31k I offered to put 2 down and monthly would have been 437. Not including the insurance I'd have to get.   At times I feel like I should have went for it but then again I tell myself I did future me a favor? I wanna test drive more cars first and fix the old na up(restoration) but it's gonna take time and$$$ and figure a new fun dd to build credit would be cool. But that's a big commitment.  Maybe I'm too chicken
1182,Interesting that the power increase provided by AIB partners has a larger impact on the 3090 than the 3080.  Looks like power limits are the main limiting factor for performance.  Curious to see how a water cooled version with a huge power limit does.

1184,I ran a multi-year campaign of 13th Age and loved it to bits.  As a GM  the monsters are SO MUCH FUN to run and encounters are so very easy to build.  You do need to have players who are capable of juggling a lot of different powers and big handfuls of dice without slowing the game to a crawl.

1186,I also have a masters in CS and now getting my second masters in applied math. You sure learn a lot of useful subjects  it can definitely give you an edge in machine learning or if you want to transition to a quant finance role it will be very helpful. But it is difficult and very hard to do it with a full time job. Doing it part time may take forever.

1188,Ok. Here we go.   Just because it is 0/1 data doesn’t mean it is skewed. Tells me you are looking at proportions.   I’d still like for you to look at non non-parametric tests.   For your question:  Look at the same 20 day period to eliminate any seasonality effect
1189,Find undergrad research opportunities and make the most of them! Great way to learn data science from experts and put yourself in position for a LOR if you ever want to go to graduate school for this. It's a very long road back from industry and I've learned that the hard way

1191,It depends on the company. The size of the company  the maturity of their data pipeline  the culture and perception of data sciences  the business domain  etc. will influence how they hire into the organization.  However  the reality is that many companies don't know what they want. They don't understand data science enough to proactively build the function into their business. Adding to this  funding is limited everywhere. The mantra is often to do more with less. This is a recipe for inefficiency and scope creep.

1193,This is extremely embarrassing  but since the pandemic began  I've been working from home and so I rarely drive my car. Maybe once a week  and if I don't need to make a supply run  sometimes once every 2 weeks. In that time  roaches have made a home in my car  and I've been having issues getting rid of them. I did a really deep clean about a month ago  sprayed Raid  and when I came back the next morning  I saw about 40 dead roaches that I quickly cleaned up. I thought the issue was solved until late one night  I went to get something out of my car  and when I opened the door and the light came on  I was horrified. The roaches were back like they never left. Help! I don't even understand why they are living in my car. There's no food in there to attract them. I'm confused by this.
1194,This  along with other reports of shady dealing by MSI  and I'm out. Never buying a MSI product. Let those cards sit on the shelf. Return them if you already have them. More stock from reputable manufacturers is coming in daily.
1195,People trash 2020 a lot  but to me it wasn't so bad  Only 1 season (Summer) was terrible.   Anyway  2021 is super promising  as you said. Looking forward to all these shows:  - Nagatoro - Gotoubun - Uzaki-chan - Zombieland Saga - Isekai Maou - Beastars - Promised Neverland - Cells at work (2 shows  it seems?) - Uma Musume - Machikado Mazoku - Bofuri - Shield Hero - Dragon Maid (Haven't watched the first season  but it's on my PTW  I'll probably catch up to it before it airs.  - Horimiya (seen a lot of hype for it) - Jaku-Chara (synopsis sounds fun) - The Romcom Where The Childhood Friend Won't Lose! (synopsis sounds fun) - My Senpai is Annoying (was on my PTR  so I guess I'll just watch it)  And I'm still hoping for a Kaguya S3 announcement  hopefully it'll be in 2021  but I'm getting worried.  And of course  I assume some great new shows will be made (The current season was such a surprise for that!)
1196,Volvo enthusiasts are pretty interesting. They tend to be very resourceful and detail oriented. Back when I was on the Volvo forums 5 years ago or so they were pretty active  too. There were a few people who ate  breathed  and slept Volvos and knew just about everything there is to know about them. There's also a guy on YouTube called RobertDIY who knows everything about P80 Volvos. I've never seen somebody devote so much time and energy into a certain type of car. Another interesting thing about Volvo fans is that there is a distinct divide between the group that likes the old school  RWD Volvos and modern  FWD Volvos.  The Saab and Mazda forums I've been on have been total snoozefests compared to the Volvo forums.
1197,Loads of characters  but they are all amazing and compelling  with actual depth to them. The twists that happen are phenomenal  you're unlikely to pick out the best ones.  And with all of the characters involved  and all of the subplots in this entire web of a series  they somehow wrap it all up with the finale. It kind of blew my minds that they managed that.  It's a good watch. But I don't recommend long breaks in between seasons  there is a lot of track. lol
1198,"There's no way you can break down game dev work like this - it just isn't how things are done.  Having ""AI"" work does not correlate to a price increase of some amount anymore than a complex bit of polish work would.  &#x200B   Anything that can be externalized simply will likely exist in an asset store package  if not  it's too specific to the game in which case you're just hiring a short-term contractor to learn a codebase  implement one thing  then stop.

1200,If this is your situation  maybe opt for the chevy volt. When I got it I didn't have electric chargers where I lived and just drove it like a regular hybrid for a year. Eventually moved to a place with chargers and now drive it on pure electricity. I definitely would not have been able to manage without the gas tank.
1201,French DS manager here so my experience might be different. Looking for a resume that gives me the impression that you've learned the basics (maths  statistics  programming...) and you know how to apply them (preferably with one or two relevant academic or personal projects). In my experience  buzzword heavy resumes are generally seen as poorly made. Maybe a French thing but I always enjoy reading a good cover letter that synthesizes your genuine interest in the company.
1202,Ammonia smell from the car (not noticeable when I'm standing outside  strongest when I sit in the driver's seat with the window open) - can it be something mechanical  or is it simply some cat being a bastard?
1203,Economy of scale probably. M.2 is used in laptops  so it is also used in desktops.  I just convert m.2 ports into u.2 ports on mobo and use u.2 drives.  The primary issue for users is u.2 cabling is a bit bulky and expensive. Even with scaled production  it would be kind of expensive cabling.
1204,I don't really care for them at all.  FATE is the worst system I've played and caused a temporary break for my game groups.  I understand some people like it but it isn't for me.  It's good that they do things you enjoy  but I'm not a fan.
1205,Hello   So currently I am working as a data scientist and started studying again on top. Apparently  I have total chaos at home now regarding hardware.  Company guidelines allow me to do testing and prototyping on private hardware (which I do  as I have it available and it is way faster than asking IT for Ressources every time).  Currently I have a small Xeon server running Ubuntu with docker and a jupyter server  a private workstation laptop (heavy and clumsy)  an powerful windows desktop  a Mac mini by my company  a laptop by my company  and an private iPad Pro („laptop replacement“).  The result is total chaos. Data of my private projects gets cluttered everywhere  I sometimes hook up laptops to docking stations even if I would need the power of the desktop as I don’t want to waste time setting up virtual Python environments over and over again  and so on.  And I feel like it’s becoming more and more of a problem as my work and studying evolves. Sometimes I just need to setup an entire new Hadoop or Spark System for testing or a few databases or whatever.  So I am thinking about what to do. I thought about upgrading my server and only rely on the server and a thin and light „dumb terminal“-Laptop. But it would be a lot of work managing  maybe expensive  and impair my work on the go as I have to work in environments where it is often simply not possible to connect to my home VPN.  The point is basically that I overall don’t need much for the most time. Python  maybe a jupyter Notebook  and that’s it. But I often stumble on points where I just suddenly need a GPU for CUDA or a few databases or a few virtual machines. And evertime one of those needs comes up I have to move my entire work up until that point from the more mobile but weak to the more static but powerful hardware (iPad -> Laptop -> Desktop <-> Server).  Another alternative I was thinking about getting an thin and light Laptop with not much power and and an mediocre desktop at home that’s just there to have a lot of storage and connect to multiple displays. I could then maybe run every project (like a single node Spark System or Django development) in an public cloud environment like on an AWS machine. This would skip the migration step from one of my hardware pieces to another and save me a lot of time and headache. But this implys a long term problem. It would be expensive to pay the upkeep of every single instance that’s not needed at the moment. So I would need a way to archive an entire cloud machine locally in case I need the work maybe months later again. I have no idea if AWS or anything provided this ability or if this idea makes financially any sense at all.  So how do you handle the hardware demands for your data science (especially data engineering) needs? Where do you prototype and test for maybe personal projects and how do you treat your work to not loose anything in the long run and can reuse it? Any experiences with the ideas I had?  Every input  suggestion or idea h
1206,Looking on ark.intel.com for the Pentium J2900  it says the maximum supported RAM is 8GB of DDR3L. But I would say to invest the money into a newer system that can take more 8GB as 16GB DDR4 based systems are quickly becoming the minimum for smooth browsing  games  any sort of editing  etc.
1207,I’ll probably end up getting an Xbox first because of the shitshow preordering a PS5 has become.  I’ll end up getting a PS5 eventually. Most of my friends and family play PS5  so I’ll probably need to get it eventually. I land in the both category.
1208,I mean  I *guess* I'm excited Feng Shui isn't dead ... but this is the last way I personally want to purchase games (from any company).  Also  if I wanted to play Feng Shui today  I'd want to play the original version (1st ed  which I still have fond memories of).  I haven't tried second edition  but I've heard nothing but bad things from people who have.
1209,I own a Omen Obelisk gaming computer. It worked fine till I bought two 4k monitors. Then it started to freeze on me. I opened it up and saw that the power supply was 500W. Researching on-line  I learned that the graphic card needs at least 600W. So is that the problem?
1210,Wow  it would have felt nice to have that back when I was in college  rather than passing around USB drives with pirated .pdfs of the sourcebooks  as the club only had a handful of physical books. Then again  that was the days of 4th edition  and basically none of the groups wanted to play it  so 3.5 it was.
1211,"**First Timer Who's Read the Book**  A funeral? Whose could it be? I'm guessing it's not Valentine's since Maximilien and Franz aren't there. Probably the butler's funeral. If so  that's actually kind of good of the Villefort's. I wouldn't expect the snooty nobility to attend the funeral of their butler. Especially in the rain.  I guess Maximilien wasn't chosen for the super soldier program due to his brains. He's been mulling this over. [What does Valentine need most right now?](https://i.imgur.com/fbcOWom.png) Ummm... Probably a doctor. Or the antidote for the poison. Both  preferably. You can be her friend/lover *after* she's not dying.  In a world of retro cars  this [regular car](https://i.imgur.com/7edexhw.png) sticks out like a sore thumb.   A scandal in the Morcerf family? What could it be?  Mercert  Villefort  and Danglers are having quite the reaction to the name 'Edmond Dantes'.  It's that [creeper](https://i.imgur.com/rlHUTds.png) from the Count's villa.  [Book](/s ""Unless I'm remembering wrong  Villefort and Danglers/Morcerf should be confused at the other party's presence at this funeral. Villefort knows what he did  and Danglers and Morcerf know what they did  but they don't know about the other group's involvement. So this connection between the three is anime original. For this at least  I truly am a first timer."")  The [drum intro at 15:31](https://i.imgur.com/L21KzR9.png) had me thinking that [Falco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8niNHOs_kU&ab_channel=FalcoVEVO) was in the coffin.   Not [Boville](https://i.imgur.com/bW3IyeW.png)! He was my favorite green-haired  glass-eyed private investigator.  I wasn't expecting a heist this episode. How did none of them see the guy in the giant wheelchair at the foot of the stairs?  I don't see grandpa falling over naturally. That wheelchair has a wide base. Someone pushed him."
1212,Without knowing the full context  I'm going play devil's advocate and say you may be reading too much into the situation. As a fellow DM  I know full well the tendency to be so wrapped up in your prep that you expect the same level of engagement from your players. In most situations  this is just not going to happen. Since we work hard on this stuff  our egos are on the line  so lack of engagement can cut to our core.  Your players were probably excited about the one-shot because you just cancelled on them. I'd be bummed if my DM randomly dipped out when a new campaign was starting. Somebody stepping up to save the day would definitely make me more excited than before.  Players in general won't have the level engagement we would hope they would have  and that is okay. To me  it sounds like your players were waiting to pull things together in the session 0. I know in the campaigns I've played in  I don't think about the game that much outside of our play sessions. When I DM campaigns  I'm thinking about it all the time.  So be careful about reading too much into this situation  and isolating yourself from your friends. People don't care as much about your game as you do and that is okay. You can meet that level engagement  or move on if that would make you happier.  I think a lot of DMs could benefit from that advice  myself included.
1213,This seems to be the case and it’s no surprise. Upscaling 64 games isn’t a big deal  Sunshine still has GameCube specific graphics in the HUD  and if your emulating the GC  it’s not a huge leap to the Wii.  Add the fact that there’s no real improvements to these titles and it’s pretty clear these aren’t remakes or ports. Which is a shame  because 64 with a toggle to include 64DS content or a version of Sunshine that was polished up a bit more to smooth some of its rough edges would be worth the price their asking.
1214,How exactly is this going to work? You cant have a set price for 'mechanics' because what defines a single mechanic? How do you know how complicated it will be? Programming simple shooting mechanics takes minutes but a complex AI pathfinding system will take more time and a more skilled programmer.  How can anyone tell you how much they would charge for 'mechanics'
1215,Strictly from a core per socket standpoint  more Chiplets could be used. I would imagine that AMD will be doing that for each node shrink. So Zen 4 at 5nm should be the next step in core count increases.   Of course  software is a bottleneck and Amdhal's Law discusses the limitations of multicore scaling.
1216,Everything is so fast these days  power doesn’t concern me. A 500hp 4 cylinder doesn’t excite me. These high performance special cars need the Big motors. It’s not because of the power it’s because of the experience: the feeling and sounds of a V8 or 12 etc is what’s important in these types of cars. There’s a reason Porsche put the flat six back in the Cayman/Boxter.
1217,"Well  if you feel daring about risking your whole rig because you've somehow gone cheapskate on the PSU with a 700-850$ GPU. Go right ahead.  I won't even say ""I told you so"" when you come to my computer repair shop to have the ""PSU failed and fried your whole system"" diagnostic I've seen so often even on the recent models with all the protective bells and whistles."
1218,In my experience you need time and ongoing practise to really understand what you are doing  and a bootcamp probably won't give you that.  I would actually like to make one at some point to compare what they teach compared to what I had at university.
1219,Seems like both Microsoft and especially Sony were really concerned about keeping the SOCs cool and the consoles quiet.   Also the PS5 SOC looks to be around the same size as the XSX's SOC give or take a bit. Makes me wonder how much space Sony's custom silicon is taking up on the die  and how different the Zen 2 and RDNA2 cores are to what's in the XSX.
1220,I mean.......try...uhhhhh jesus this is hard because most anime hell most media (anime and books) in general have a love intrest or some type of love scenario in mind uhhhhh   Samauri Champloo is good one
1221,I have a 2015 Volvo s60 with the turbo 5. It has 65000miles on it.  I have gone 6500 miles since my last oil change (the manufacturer interval is 10k  but I normally do it earlier) and I was down 1 quart of oil.  Is this amount of consumption something I should be really concerned about  or is it typical and I just have to top it off more often from now on?  There is no smoke from the exhaust  or drips of oil on my driveway.  I'm getting an oil change this week  and I will probably ask them to check it out.
1222,TN isn't as fast as they claim either.  Top-end TN panels are about 2.6ms and top-end nano-IPS is about 3.7.  https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/images/lg_38gl950g/comparison_4.png  While I think you're right that the market has not drastically changed from where it was 5 years ago  prices have certainly gotten better  a 144 Hz 1440p IPS monitor used to be $700 and up until COVID you could get a Nixeus EDG 27v2S for $300  even today you can get a LG 27GL83A for $380.  That's a huge improvement.    In terms of specifications  at the high end IPS ultrawides became a thing  first 75 Hz  then 100 Hz  then 120 Hz  then 144 Hz  now 160 Hz  and [Acer is releasing a 200 Hz IPS that's just been spotted on Taobao.](https://videocardz.com/newz/acer-predator-x34s-34-inch-uwqhd-200hz-nano-ips-monitor-spotted)  4K monitors went from 60 Hz to 144 Hz at the same price point (plus the FALD backlight models that nobody cares about).  VA has gone from total trash to being something that I'll grudgingly admit is acceptable in some circumstances (if you are willing to shell out for a top end $2000 model).  The new Odyssey models are pretty OK.  It also got HDR capability and so on.  I feel your frustration though  display technology moves at a languid pace and even when they give specific dates they often wildly blow the expected time tables.
1223,Does any know what song this is? Please ignore the shark part at the end but I want to know the song at the beginning of this video where the anime girl is on. I'd appreciate anyone's help  thank you!!  https://reddit.com/link/j9dg7k/video/hxe9awu85js51/player
1224,"My trajectory was  1. I LOVE math. 2. Was working as an Applied Mathematician (after watching friends cycle through postdoc  postdoc  postdoc and deciding that wasn't for me). 3. \~7 years ago A colleague told me - ""Scratch Applied Mathematician off your resume - you are a Data Scientist now"". 4. ""That title sounds silly  but sure why not"" 5. Another former colleague informed me he was working remotely from my favorite coffee shop as a Data Scientist. I was sold :D"
1225,I recently had to learn this too. I ended up putting my ML models into a flask server and had it running on an AWS ec2 server. This might not be the best way to do it (still learning lol) but it’s simple so I hope this helps.  Here is an example of how to put an ml model into a flask app [(MoldAI)](https://github.com/vladthesav/MoldAI).   Also I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5KTLzN85O4KTCYzsWZPTP0BfRj6I_yUP) tutorial to get it running on ec2.  Again  I’m still learning so it might not be the best way to do it but I hope this helps :)
1226,Try and find a local cars and coffee or car show. They are usually free and in parking lots. They may be a bit smaller than normal due to COVID  but it is always outside so it is fairly safe. Highly recommend something like that. Even if you dont like cars very much they can be pretty fun because the people are always so cool.
1227,As others have mentioned  AWD is generally quicker from a dig  and sometimes from a lower roll depending on power. However the drivetrain loss and weight holds the vehicle back in terms of speed. Cars with variable power transfer help with the issue of drivetrain loss  although there is still some additional friction from the front diff and such. Rob Dahm does a good job of explaining and dealing with it in his AWD 4 rotor videos.
1228,A 370z has plenty of torque so the risk of stalling is not that bad and is very forgiving to shifting too soon. I learned to drive stick in a 2004 RX-8 that makes basically no torque which is much harder. She’ll be fine and so will your clutch.
1229,This may be 100% true. BUT  &#x200B   It's Nvidia.  I don't believe Nvidia.  When Nvidia says the demand was too big  I say they rushed the launch (proven by supply issues and driver issue) just to spoil the marketing for AMD camp.  They care about people getting enough cards? Yeah  right. Why not in terms of fast cards?  But slower cards are just by coincidence the ones that are delayed. Not like we ever saw this tactic to push more expensive stuff to buyers  right? No company ever took steps to push people from cheaper to more expensive hardware.   Lack of 3070 will push people to order 3080.  Just like pushing 3080 and 3070 without sufficient amount of memory first is just a coincidence and way overblown price of 16 and 20GB version will also be a coincidence.  )  &#x200B   As I started with - I will repeat. I might be completely wrong on it. Just food for thought. You decide for yourself what to think about it.
1230,I have an affinity for Math & Stats.  I'm doing many of the things that you mentioned in your post and it can feel overwhelming. Finding a study group or creating one where you're working together to reach a goal is helpful.  It helps to keep each other accountable and on schedule to meet the goal.  If you want we can start one a particular Math/Stat subject.  You can use a combination of materials.  Some excellent ones have already been suggested in the responses to your post  and you can augment it with text and video resources.  Have you decided on what subject you want to tackle first?
1231,I've noticed over the years that MSI has become increasingly shady with their actions. As a consumer it's hard for me to to trust their business practices nor their organization as a whole. I am swaying towards other brands and manufacturers in the future.
1232,If you have posted your previous works property in the open on Github I would never hire you as i dont want you to do the same when you work for me. Dont do it  its a crazy idea and you should soul search and mature a bit for even coming up with the idea of sharing your works property without consent solely to promote yourself. Not cool.
1233,Reality is al my devices just aren’t usb c. There’s always that one thing or that other thing. I carry: - Phone - earbuds - smart watch - smart keychain - vape (blah blah I know) - laptop - battery pack  Daily. And that means 4 different chargers  unless I want to buy a fancy vape and fancy battery back with usb c  and fancy laptop charger then I can get it down to 2 chargers. But then my laptop wouldn’t charge as fast...  Really the only benefit to usb c beyond bandwidth and flexibility is if all your stuff is usb c  which just isn’t possible to find. My coffee maker is micro usb and they aren’t switching anytime soon!  Moreover  having only usb c is still a major hinderance. I don’t have a single computer peripheral that is usb c beyond my hub and dongles. It’s all usb A or hdmi
1234,> Not all data science problems can be answered with ML  but has anyone seen any Kaggle competitions where some of the higher scoring techniques were not ML-based?  Probably not. Kaggle is a competition and the saying is really about solving problems to a satisfactory level.  The saying should really be “problem plus data definition and understanding are crucial parts of solving problems”
1235,I'm thinking the problem is the TYPE of data analyst that you are right now. Consider working in a different field  such as health care  etc.  I hate Finances & auditing as well. But I love conducting analyses & creating dashboards  etc.   Good luck. Don't give up what you love.  The first step of being an intellect  is understanding that you suck and something  then consciously improving on it.
1236,One of the few anime to disturb me.  The gore itself didn't bother me too much but  the show seemed to crush the hope out of you with the context of some of the deaths.  The dad  Taro  Miki and the guy that falls dead from the car made me feel awful.
1237,>  Powered by the Apocalypse is out because of there already being discontent with it. They said they wanted some mechanics to use and don't like how PBTA does mechanics.  Fair. PbtA  while fun  felt more like a story than any actual form of GAME.  For what it's worth  I endorse Genesys. Good balance between narrative and game  especially in combat situations. The pass/fail + threat/advantage mechanics of the dice are very good.  Feel free to ask me questions about it  but I've run Genesys (and had it run for me) for... well  a long damn time now. I've tried other stuff  but Genesys seems to be the best for now.
1238,"I have seen posts asking if the person in question is ""too old"" for anime.   Anime is like any other form of entertainment  in that there is no age limit.  Of course you aren't gonna show a 4 year old ""naughty"" stuff."

1240,In anticipation for the upcoming Cyberpunk RED rpg  I'm planning a mission. A gang took over a classy hotel for their operations. A whole bunch of women  both runaways and kidnapped  are being held there by the gang. The players are hired to find out what the crooks are doing there. Any good idea for a twist or whacky surprise to inject?
1241,So just come background context  I'm a SWE intern at a medium sized company and my main responsibilities have been working on a product that heavily uses ML techniques and algorithms to get this job done. I spend all my working hours in Jupyter Notebooks trying different models and tuning them to get desired results and whatnot. I also spend my work time reading research papers that can help to contribute to the overall product I am working on. So back to my question. I joined as a Software Engineer but I picked my project to be related to ML because that is what I was interested in. Now  which role am I actually playing right now? Is the work I'm doing considered to fall under Machine Learning Engineer responsibilities or am I still in the Software Engineer area? And how important are these titles in terms of career growth if I want to work in ML in the future?
1242,Where I am norcal  the car scene is deader than dead. Only spotty remains of japanese sports cars remain.  Whenever you do see a japanese car that still gets taken out  its a track prepped s2000.  Kids in general where I live do not want to learn about cars or sports cars or learn to drive. They want to learn about league of legends or whatever popular video game is.   The older kids will gravitate towards luxury japanese cars and some will go towards miatas  s2000s  and frsbrz.
1243,I'd be lying if I didn't say samurai champloo and cowboy bebop were my favorites (the music is part of the story  in addition to just enhancing it)  but wolf's rain and attack on titan are way up there too
1244,Hey folks!   I’m wanting to get into data science / data analytics. I’m going to start a self paced / guided course through coursea. I was wondering if any one who is currently in this field would be willing to let me pay them to ask questions if needed? Maybe we could work out a monthly price? I’ve been learning python  SQL and R through Udemy. I anticipate questions about issues with my code as I work through the lessons. Having someone to ask for help with my code issues would help me get through this a lot faster. I refuse to pay 50k for a boot camp because I already have student loans from a degree that is useless these days. If anyone is willing maybe we can work something out?
1245,This episode got me interested again in this show. I was kinda annoyed that the first episode was the first one. I'm looking forward to how the story will play out now. I love the old cast  but the show should be about their kids.   Also already in love with Towa  she stays ready so she doesn't have to get ready!
1246,Whenever you are in an rpg of ANY setting the FIRST thing you do is not say hi don’t introduce yourself  don’t even make allies. You scan the room and determine what if anything is flammable because in an rpg if it can burn it will eventually. Fire is a weapon you never have to sharpen and can be summoned without your soul always know what can burn and how to keep it Around your friends and foes! Because when everything goes up in smoke you will be the one who stamps out the cinders.
1247,Gas usually lasts about a year from my experience before it starts to cause issues  and then only sometimes. Your battery will go flat. Your tires will be flat-spotted after a year. Your parking brake should be off if you plan to park for more than a couple weeks.
1248,If it’s 2d  and you’re not going for anything too graphical. Game maker studio 2 is amazing. I know some people suggested RPG Maker too  don’t use that I used it it was very linear and not very flexible.
1249,"It's definitely not an easy thing to get over.  A few things that come to mind (note that I am not a therapist or psychologist and your mileage may vary):    1. Find out where your specific anxieties are coming from.  For me  I've spent a lot of time running interconnected games (LARPs  living games  etc).  Thus  most of my anxiety comes from NOT having the freedom to do everything I want or that my players want to explore  as well as running the risk that I'll upset players by ruining their character arcs (which are often a lot more self-guided in a connected game because of the number of people involved and the fact that PCs can travel).  You seem to be tying it to prep  so that may be a factor  but you also note the anxiety when someone thanks you for it.  Maybe there is something there.      1. If you're experiencing this outside of a game context  it may be something more than just game anxiety.  At that point  it may be worth talking to a therapist or counselor - there may be more going on  and you may be able to work with them to find the common factors. 2. Remember that it's only a game.  Yes  there could be hurt feelings if something goes awry  that can happen if you accidentally say something at a bar  though.  This is meant to be fun  not a chore.  The world doesn't end if you flub a rule call  and we can go back and fix mistakes.   3. Take some time and write up random things one night a week.  An NPC  a small set-up in a tavern  something minor that doesn't take too long.  Or add some small details to something that already exists.  Or things that could be tacked on to something that exists.  Put these in a folder on your computer or wherever you store game prep.  When you feel anxious you haven't done enough prep  remind yourself that if you find you don't have enough prep  you have a slush folder of stuff to draw from.  Feel free to spend a little time searching for stuff others have done online as well.  If you can tell that worry ""Hey  I've done enough  and if I haven't I have insurance "" it may calm you down. 4. If your players are sending you stuff right after the game  ask them to send you compliments 24 hours later.  Explain that you appreciate them  but that for some reason you get a bit on-edge when you get that message - be truthful and forthcoming with them and set up a buffer.  In my LARP clubs  there's often been an official or unofficial 24 hour rule about contacting with a complaint  but I also find it great to just push ANY discussion with the GM outside of the postgame food run to 24 hours out just to let everyone settle - it may be that you're still on edge from the game."
1250,Different rules sets are better at supporting different games  both in setting and tone. I would not like to play only one.    However  if I had to choose  it’d be D&D 3.5. Mostly because I have the most experience and the most resources for that system (including 3rd party products like the excellent Dragonmech).
1251,I assume my players are at the same level of awareness regarding the overarching story and the desires of the NPCs as I am. Sometimes they'll miss obvious hooks or details that reveal a lot. Then I realise it has something to do with me planning and building the world for hours on end and not just playing the session on the weekends!
1252,For any of you working in it right now  what’s it like? My background is in civil engineering and after 1 year of working in the field I’ve realized I’m really not passionate about this field at all and just sort of stumbled into it. I’ve always been super passionate  about video games and have thought that working on a game or for platforms that revolve around gaming would be amazing. I was just curious on your guys thoughts if it’s really something amazing before I just jumped into more schooling to pursue it.
1253,Something is pulling me hard to get this card  but since I'm changing card every 3 years  and using 1440p monitor  don't think this one will hold for that long.   Gonna wait on reviews  but think 3080 is better for 3 years of not worrying too much about GPU not being good enough.
1254,">he 3.5mm jack is not a purchase condition - unlike the presence of full-size USB and HDMI.""  I suspect because most consumers haven't contemplated it not being there.  With WFH  my 3.5mm jack is seeing all its time with my nice wired speakers (which I have no desire to replace - no Moore's Law for desktop speakers) plugged in."
1255,"So  I make a lot of notes these days  and I thought I might share some of the material for this game.  I have made it systemless for now  but can add some further details  and some notes for the first two missions if people are interested.  The group wanted something fairly gritty  without much of a combat focus.  We also decided to go for a rather morally ambivalent position  with victories often being limited.  The strap line probably be ""Tinker  Tailor  Soldier  Psychic  Spy""  https://www.dropbox.com/s/3it3wsz2gt4tler/psychic%20spies%20%28systemless%29.pdf?dl=0"
1256,So considering the amount of Apple-bashing that tech enthusiasts are stereotypically known for  I was surprised to hear that a lot of people prefer Mac OS for data science  as being UNIX based  it's actually better for data science purposes.    Other people say that the constraints of Apple devices like lower specs and not being able to add to the hardware means Windows is better.  And the third opinion is that it doesn't matter  Linux Master race rules all.    It seems all 3 have their pros and cons. So in your opinion  what would be better for the kind of work data science entails?
1257,I want to make a one-shot with a spy mission similar to something one  might see in an episode of Archer or a Mission Impossible movie  but I  am having trouble coming up with a good idea that will be fun to play as  a one-shot.   If it matters I will do this in Genesys  but I don't really need help implementing it. I just need some help with brainstorming good ideas that work well in a TTRPG. Thanks!
1258,"My E46 has been to the dealer 3 times - twice for the passenger's side  and once for the driver's side. The last time round was this summer  and I decided to take it to the dealer by my house instead of the one that knows my car  50 mins away. Basically kept getting ignored after following up so many times so I emailed that other dealer and they called me and we had an appointment set up within half an hour.   So then I proceeded to roast the dealership by my house with online reviews  only then did they say ""oh sorry if you want to discuss this please call me"". Whatever  not going to waste my time with that BS and hopefully this is the last time my car has to go to the dealer"
1259,giving the players a massive problem they have to work out how to solve.. like working out how to scout a building or access to the building without alerting anyone that that is what they're doing because that would give the game away.. they'll argue for hours over how to do it then fail at the first hurdle..
1260,Genesys could be fun  it's magic system is super customizable  but I'd really recommend World (or Chronicles) of Darkness.  You can basically just play Mage  or use Sorcerer (Second Sight if CoD) rules if you want a more human approach.   That being said  as someone else has pointed out  Call of Cthulhu (BRP) has a super open magic system too  so really I'd ask what kind of tone/mood are you going for?  Edit: Grammar.
1261,Sometimes the best way to another project is through the muck. What I’ve done in the past to motivate myself was to set goals each morning while waking to work. I would pump myself up to hit any goal. I moved all meetings to the afternoon so I could get the goal finished then I would be happy to talk with someone else.   If you are really suffering  have you thought about asking to be moved to a different project or area? Doesn’t sound like that’s what you want to do  but sometimes change is good.  If you do jump to a different team or company  there’s always a potential of a different project with a little more money.
1262,Harassment  Crunch  and Layoffs are three things that have been consistently reported on in AAA studios.   From a job security perspective  Crunch and Layoffs are difficult to change without organizing Unions/Strikes to establish collective bargaining power. But there is the risk that such organized actions will get you silenced and fired.  People have Families. Do you risk going with no pay to unionize and strike and risk losing your job? Many people in the USA live pay check  to pay check and don't have a lot of savings to take on that risk. Plus finding a new job can take a long time and can often mean relocating.  From a culture perspective  harassment and crunch requires removing the people that cause the toxic culture. This can be difficult to do if all of management is toxic and HR doesnt want to do their job. Also  when you sign your employee contract  a lot of times issues like these will get settled in arbitration.  Crunch is both business issue and a passion issue. If you have no money  and you crunch to get the game out the door. If you are a solo dev that wants to achieve perfection and a good launch  you crunch. If you want to get paid for delivering milestone work  you crunch. If devs had no idea what game they were making until 6 months before release  and your publisher expects a game to release on the designated date  you crunch.
1263,"Early (pre-AD&D) editions of D&D seem to fit the listed criteria  as do many of the various OSR retro- and neo-clones.  [B/X D&D](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) (Tom Moldvay's 1981 Basic D&D book  and the associated Expert D&D) seems to be the most highly-regarded ""genuine TSR"" early edition and a lot of current products are based on B/X."
1264,I usually run a spooky game every year in whatever system I happen to be running at the time. This year I'm doing Cyberpunk RED. The party will wake up unarmed in an abandoned apartment block with a boosterganger suffering from cyberpsychosis hunting them through the building. He'll have a special ability where he can diminish damage and spend some of his health to escape any compromising situation after the players have gotten out of his grasp  ensuring that slasher film pacing. At the end they'll find out the whole thing was recorded and orchestrated by a media corp wanting to come out with a new horror braindance chip.  This is to show that when October comes around  even a nonhorror system can do a good job of telling a horror story. The closest I run to a pure horror setting is Blades in the Dark(I run WoD in the 80's  with a bigger focus on action movie tropes and excess as a core theme  as opposed to the usual horror.)  which I definitely advise giving a shot.

1266,Aside from the marketing of your phd - you really should just lead with your phd topic if it does as much quant work then put the actual phd major at the end.  You are applying a lot to NYC which has a smaller market filled with more experienced applicants and hires. SF takes fresher folks and a good place to get your first experience   Your phone screen loss rate needs more details? Did you get screened by HR or the first round?  If it is the first round you probably need to keep a record of the questions you missed or where asked if you cant tell which went wrong
1267,For being a pretty new system  Lancer has a surprisingly large amount of support from its fans. A decent chunk of homebrew mechs  plenty of fan made missions  and am enormous amount of maps and tokens (and that's not counting what retrograde minis' handiwork).
1268,Here are some examples of times I needed good math understanding in my DS job:  1. Learning the new state of the art algorithms. They usually come out in papers first before making it to the mainstream. In these papers  there often be a lot math and you’ll have a terrible time with understanding the paper if you can’t understand the math.  2. Designing custom loss functions. This is literally a mathematical equation  so you can’t make it without knowing math.  2.1 assessing loss functions. You can’t least square or cross entropy every problem.  3. Debugging your model. Is your code or your model that’s not working? You need to understand different error signatures and then when you debug deep enough  you’ll hit the numerical side of things. For example  recently  my deep learning model was giving me 0 loss which is only possible if everything was correct with 100% confidence. But of course  that was not the case  even on the training set. I had to trace the bug all the way to an embedding layer that would suddenly have NaN gradients. Figured out that a particular data point had some invalid structures that broke the code. Now I know this didn’t use math directly  but if I didn’t understand how everything was mathematically built  I would have been lost and probably would have gave up on the approach.  Math isn’t strictly required to be a data scientist.. you could make that up in other ways. I had a junior data scientist that had weak math. He did okay  still got work done  but I don’t foresee him climbing much higher on the technical ladder until he understood things more deeply. Hope that helps.
1269,Managed to sneak in an order for this one. Not the prettiest card  but at least i get it sometime in the next few weeks (hopefully). Benchmarks/temps look good. I am surprised that these cards are still running around 10-15C cooler than the FE.
1270,I really appreciate seeing a potential salary range  not many companies provide this in the listing  but those that do automatically get my respect and then I’m not wasting everyone’s time by applying for something that isn’t in my salary range that I’m just going to turn down. This is especially important since I’ve seen salaries for analyst roles really range even within my company.   I also think this transparency builds trust in the potential employer as an applicant and should be standard. Because you know what your salary range is before you even post the job  sure maybe you can get a good applicant for slightly cheaper by withholding that information  but do you really want to do that with talent that you want to retain?
1271,If you want more fps you need more processing power that's it a better processor or a better graphic card. Ram may be your problem if you've got a bottleneck there   Launch your game and open the task admin where you will find some graphics that give you disk  cpu  network and memory performance and look there. If you are out of ram that could cause problems with fps. But you need to know where your bottleneck is first.
1272,I did! PhD in theoretical physics  transitioned to data science. HATED it  because I like the 'compiler theory' side of optimization and actually prefer straight software development or web development to data science. I transitioned to a DevOps Engineering role about 3 years ago  now am between senior platform applications engineer and lowest level of staff scientist 1. I'm 100% cloud based service providers now but when I first started was working with a Kubes cluster and multiple hosted sites + DBs in an on prem environment. The pay is slightly better than what I was making as a data scientist but the work is much more demanding. That being said I truly enjoy it - the only part of data science I liked was statistics  and most data science roles are more ML + business focused. Also I have almost no patience when it comes to training a model for some reason but can spend 3 weeks on process optimization and site availability / traffic analysis for cluster backends and it seems like only 3 hours passed. All I can say is if you hate it  there are other equally technical roles that are as fulfilling and that pay as well or better and that are less competitive. I've never seen a SRE position described as 'sexy' hahaha
1273,Finished this towards the end of last week. Thanks to everyone on r/rpg who was so supportive of the first post :) It was the first time I've ever gotten that much love for anything I've made. You're all awesome
1274,error my ass   oh why are all our new hot take items out of stock where did this extra money come from.  its really they got caught downplay it nice words hey refund or partial we order the them to do if they know it.  really this happen because these aib partners enjoyed 1200+ 2080ti sales for past few years and seeing nvidia actually going back to semi normal pricing cut the bottom line for a lot of people including nvidia overall.
1275,Small warning that Intel does not *explicitly* provide retail consumer warranty support for their standalone laptop form factor cards. I learned that the hard way after I bought a card new from Dell and then spent 7 hours combined on the phone and email to finally get a reimbursement check in the mail when the card died.  The only reason I got the check is I asked them to show me in writing exactly where the card wasn't supported. Of course  they couldn't.  And no  Dell said Intel product  Intel warranty.  Just a heads up in case you're considering upgrading a notebook or motherboard NIC with one of these.

1277,The demo from a few months ago was all over the place.   Everything about the character interactions  and combat seemed really cool! But I think the odd slice of the story they gave you was confusing and limiting. This game seems like it NEEDS the full context for any of it to matter.   I think it was a good idea to leave out a demo for the kickstarter. Sell the game on the merit of a trailer  some gifs  and a written description! That should honestly win over far more people than a shaky first look
1278,"It's entirely possible that there's still some response curve tuning to be done  but this is kinda what you *want* to have happen: you only want the fans on and loud to the point of avoiding temperatures that compromise the longevity of the components. Modern components withstand quite a lot of heat just fine. If systems *aren't* running warm during use  it means they're over-cooling and sacrificing quiet for excessive temperature control.  We don't and probably never will have public the full spec sheets of the custom architectures involved  but as a comparison point  AMD has stated that localized 110°C hot spots are ['normal and within spec'](https://www.techpowerup.com/258228/110-c-hotspot-temps-expected-and-within-spec-amd-on-rx-5700-series-thermals) for the rx5700  which is based on the same generation of display tech. Exhaust at even half that temperature is going to feel alarmingly warm to a human hand yet pose no problem to the components involved.  If we start seeing mass heat failures or discover load tests in 40°C rooms were conspicuously missing from the validation matrix  then I think we can start worrying. But by itself  ""it seems kind of warm"" sounds to me like ""this was actually paid close attention to and optimized correctly.""  Storage expansion feeling really hot in standby is a different concern that seems weird  but who knows if it's still downloading/updating/whatever at that point—and storage works hot  too."
1279,You are currently employed as a Tableau and Alteryx consultant then you're not exactly completely out of the field of data science  you just want to pivot into more custom/technical stuff  so don't see it as a binary make it or don't make it.  If you have opportunities to integrate DS or ML more into your current work  do that. It can be hard to find motivation to go through exercises or challenges on your own. What about working on a data analytics blog post about a topic that you're interested in? I just looked at your posts and you seem to be interested in some incomprehensibly nerdy form of game  are there datasets related to it? Crunch them  visualise them  post the results to subreddits.
1280,"I am looking forward for the last arc that will be animated  but I hope some adaptions are done. Not necessarily going to say ""real ending""  but what we got on the manga was BS.  Honestly  the manga could have been so much better explored  so many concepts that Kubo simply dropped (or someone made him drop those ideas)  still if they fix the ending  I will be more than happy."
1281,I own the same generation of bonneville and have looked into this. It has actually [been done](https://i.imgur.com/FUiaBp5.png) before! [Here's a full write up of someone that's done this.](https://www.gmforum.com/electrical-133/00-center-tail-light-up-write-up-287275/)
1282,Not sure if this would be the correct subreddit (please forgive me if so).  So I am looking for a laptop around $1 000 I am just starting my journey on learning computers  but essentially want one for some light gaming  mainly for editing photos and videos  preferably not Apple. Thank all in advance.
1283,Okay so I study games programming at uni and one of our modules is cross disciplinary  where we work alongside web students to create a project. We chose to make a multiplayer 2D shooter game for mobile  where the player has to register on our website before being able to log in and play. The website allows users to create a profile where they can keep track of their in-game performance. So they can view statistics like KDR  hours logged  most used weapons etc.  So we initially planned to use Firebase for all our backend stuff. We needed a real-time database for networked gameplay  and a cloud storage for General player data. However  after doing a bit of research  we realised that our needs required us to upgrade from Firebase’s “Free” plan to their pay as you go “Blaze” plan. Now the problem is that we’re all uni students  so most of us do not have money to just throw into the project  especially when it can get quite expensive with all the data a multiplayer game can potentially consume. What’s more is that this is just a uni project  so most likely we’d forget about it after submission day.  What I’m asking is if there are any free alternatives to Firebase or a better way to go about handling the backend stuff of this project? We’d need more than one database.
1284,Hey everyone  I am a data analyst atm but am thinking of moving towards data science as programming is something I'm not that great at  but would really love to improve in a working environment. I have knowledge of SQL but would consider myself beginner/intermediate as I do use it at work but not to an advanced level. I also have knowledge of Python  Maltab  C++ but this was all theoretical work at uni and do not really remember the programs. What is recommended to go down the DS pathway? Like can anyone help me with a long term plan to follow? Such as learn python first  do this next etc.. Or any general advice would be fantastic. It would be very much appreciated. And I hope everyone is well and safe!
1285,I want to add some diversity in my game project and one of the charcters are non [binary.is](https://binary.is) it okay if I include them even if i myself am a cis women?Same question goes but with another charcter that doesn'ta have normal arms her pigtails being like hands for her(They re ghosts and manipulate their ghost form howveer they want with some expections.)
1286,**First timer**  gonna be late  The 'princess' goes to check on Jiron handcuffed in the cell? Is she going to be the love interest?  She was 'worried'? And is annoyed he didn't greet her properly?  Jiron is crying again?  Zylar and Carrying have really red skin ... I'm not sure if I'm watching the DVD version or not.  There's a lot of tonal whiplash  and scenes abruptly cutting into something completely different  I feel like Reconguista in G all over again  and not in a good way. Are all Tomino shows like this?  The Iron Gear reminds me of the ship mecha from Gurren Lagann.  Not sure why they keep bringing up 'three days'...  I can see 50+ episodes of this really grating on me ... we don't even seem to have much plot yet.  Even though they were named  Zylar  Millay  Marl and Haiya don't get voice credits in the ED. This is really bothering me.
1287,Really disappointed you can’t get this in Polymetal Grey or the red leather you can find in the Miata.   That would have been an amazing combination to only offer in the turbo trim.   It’s still pretty pricey for what it is but it’s a great deal for people looking for cheap luxury performance with some reliability.   Anyone looking for pure performance is going to go for a veloster N of CTR. People that need all wheel drive will cross shop this with a WRX so at least there’s another car to compete with the WRX now  even if it’s pricier.   I hope this sells well and Mazda sees that people want performance.
1288,I like the feel of this show  though I suspect it might end up being too wacky for its own good. I'm curious to see if they'll ever explain the bird  because it looks like a magical familiar. The question is who does it belong to  Rei  her dead mum or granny?
1289,"really trying to understand the different ways into data science.  I'm assuming you may use latent knowledge of calculus  discrete math and introductory statistics.  Even if you don't directly apply it.    ""For those of you who don’t directly use any math/ stats in your jobs  what do you do?"""
1290,So I just finished assassination classroom and damn I m just damn so I need some new anime like comedy and shonan jump like one piece or assassination classroom please let it have dub I am not a fast reader for sub
1291,Sounds like you and your group are [narrativists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory).  D&D was the first  which is why it's the most well known. They keep updating it  but at its heart it's the same wargame that it was back in the 70s. Right now there are more than 20 000 rpgs out there in nature. Though less well known to the general public  a lot of them have a better gameplay than D&D  are easier to learn and GM  and have a lot more role-playing and less combat focus.  Based on what you're describing  I would recommend [Houses of the Blooded](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/61061/Houses-of-the-Blooded). It's antithetical to D&D  since you're playing the nobles of a house and must negotiate everything and establish a dynasty rather go dungeon delving.  Other than that  anything [Powered By The Apocalypse games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse)  a game design paradigm that's it's easy to learn  easy to play  and covers anything from fantasy to cyberpunk and beyond. Some of them offer more combat than others  but all are more narrative oriented than most of the games on the market.  If you want fantasy  there's Dungeon World. It's the same experience as D&D but a lot easier to learn and play since it has a more modern  narrative oriented ruleset. Since it's theater of mind  you don't need interactive battlemaps  and everything required to run it can be found [here](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8_Fz4m5hcoieW1GRVVaNnRfbnc/view)  Edit: [Dungeon World review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKfzU9vOQKg)  [Learn to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZA54LQ9oMM)  [Campaign Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooa-apRt2wk&list=PL-oTJHKXHicRNYOc9unj3D1GMzjz_i6V2)  [Downloadables](https://dungeon-world.com/downloads/)  If you get bored of fantasy  there's Monsterhearts 2E  Urban Shadows  and The Veil. All PBTA  all similar in respect that it's more about politics and swapping favors  with less emphasis on combat.   There are also other  stranger choices out there. My Life With Master is an episodic game where you play the minions of a frankenstein type mad scientist. Mouseguard allows you to play mice kinghts fighting against cats and snakes. [Dread](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/83854/Dread) is a horror game that uses a Jenga tower as a resolution. Itras By is a card based surrealist game. Ten Candles is a horror game based on light and candles. Dialect  There are also plenty of one page RPGs  like Lasers and Feelings. There's even a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/onepagerpgs/) for them.  If you really want to go on the deep end  try diceless stuff like Nobilis  Amber  [Polaris: Chivalric Tragedy at Utmost North](https://p-h-lee.itch.io/polaris)  [Undying](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/174206/Undying) or Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine.
1292,Hi!  I have a couple questions.  1) What is the job market like? In terms of salary and demand.  2) Is it a feasible career to go into  with a psychology degree and no math background?  3) Is a masters enough or is a PhD needed?  4) What is an average work day like?
1293,What do you recommend to a final year student with no major? (BSc. in Physics  Math  CS)  I am currently learning DL. I am comfortable with ML. I have good coding skills. I am proficient in Python (sklearn  PyTorch)  SQL  Julia  Js  etc. And prior experience with C++.  I have good math skills  and I thrive in mathematically rigorous projects/courses.  Should I try to look for jobs  or should I do 4 year degree in CS? What do you suggest?
1294,I'm still waiting to see more Series X games running on Series X. Improved backward compatibility is awesome and all  but personally I am not gonna play any BC titles much. When I do play BC games  I'm very excited for the faster load times though.
1295,I get really anxious to actually run a session. Everything seems super fun up until game day  and then stage fright sets in. To the point where sometimes I'd just rather not play. And then that can snowball week to week if I'm not careful.  I probably can get over this with practice  but how do you practice when you get anxious about spinning up a game group in the first place? Ugh.
1296,Wait a minute  so is the memory getting to 4Gbps or just the interface? It looks like they used 3.6Gbps from SK Hynix. 460GB/s is the bandwidth you get from 3.6Gbps HBM  not 4Gbps HBM (which would be 512GB/s).   > Rambus Inc. ... announced it has achieved a record 4 Gbps performance with the Rambus HBM2E memory interface solution consisting of a fully-integrated PHY and controller. **Paired with the industry’s fastest HBM2E DRAM from SK hynix operating at 3.6 Gbps**  the solution can deliver 460 GB/s of bandwidth from a single HBM2E device.  Also  /u/dylan522p  check out that non-existent 3.6Gbps HBM from fucking SK Hynix of all people. If garbage-tier SK Hynix can get to 3.6Gbps  then Sammy can get to 3.2Gbps in volumes high enough for Sienna Cichlid and then AMD can dual-source between the two. <3
1297,"In my opinion D&D is a good game mostly because it's a **solid system**  with **a lot of players**    gaming and testing it so it's a game that **works fine**. It has **a ton of content** and published books in almost any language and it's pretty **popular** to find everywhere  so it's also easy to find people to engage and play it.    The flaws I see in D&D is that's a system that encourages **combat** overall and characters can be sometimes pretty **overpowered** and almost feel as some kind of super-heroes. The settings are usually too ""fantasy **generic**"" and a little ""kiddish"" and that it's something that I've trying to avoid through the years of playing and reading.   But overall I think D&D is a good game which I enjoy DM and playing especially with my own settings. But sometimes I also enjoy having a different gaming experience with other systems that are more focused in creating different enviornments and experiences to the player."
1298,"Interesting that so many people like the d100 system. I've always found that it makes odds a bit too clear  scales in weird ways  and does not allow for many interesting modifiers or modulations.  I always get horrific flashbacks to Dark Heresy  where you start with a 35% chance under ideal circumstances at the things you're supposed to be good at  and then at some point stack so much gear porn and random little modifiers that you end up at 140% and the only question is how insanely well you succeed rather than whether you succeed at all.  To this day I haven't found a single d100 system that I thought had solid rules once taken apart. (Though in Dark Heresy for example  the toughness/armour/weapon balance is also incredibly easy to skew in bad ways  and the ways combat actions are set up inspires static turns of ""I shoot it. I shoot it more.""  so it's not all the fault of the d100.)"
1299,   Dear Data Scientists / Analysts  (I really need help)  I am an graduate of BBA Finance / BBA Marketing with a very low GPA of 2.38 due to a personal matter and due to having a full time job of 12 hours during my studies  which should not be an excuse.  I am looking to study in Canada  mainly to get a PGWP to be honest  but as a Business field student  I've been interested in MBA but It's expensive  and I was told to avoid it as employers tend to pay for it  and it would cost more than Data Science & Analytics  I am trying to find a good university/college that has a graduate full-time Diploma with a duration of   1 to 2 years for Data Science & Analytics in Canada  mainly in Alberta or British Columbia or any affordable rent province/city that has a good quality of life as I've heard that Canada is a province country and it's better to study at the place you want to live in  I really want Alberta but unfortunately only University of Calgary provides such degree and they do not accept anyone under 2.5 GPA under any circumstances </3  Thank you for reading this far  I'll appreciate any kind of assistance :)
1300,I run a DnD game.  Then I invite players who enjoy my DnD game to my other game.  They enjoy it  so they talk about it  and players from the other game join in.  Soon enough I have a solid game that isn't DnD.  Of course  I still have to run DnD  but it is a chore I do to GM what I want.
1301,Think of the anxiety as your ally. It keeps you on your toes and keeps you from going stale. So: believe others when they compliment you  but stay anxious before the game.  If they keep coming back you're doing fine. If they start finding excuses to postpone or skip games you're probably gone stale :D
1302,Digital Foundry did a really good video on this game comparing PC 4K native with PS4 Pro 4K checkerboarding for anyone who wants some more info.    https://youtu.be/ljgCy4Y2sHc  Another note is that this game is very heavy on PC and I think 3080 is the first GPU able to run it at 4K maxed with a solid 60fps.
1303,Hello  I have two questions about external hard drives.  I have a few Western Digital My Passport USB 2.0 external hard drives that I am slowly replacing because of size  speed  and reliability issues and I have two questions:  1. Is there any reason to keep those drives if they are too small  slow  and not always reliable? My guess is no  but I feel silly throwing them out. 2. 2. Is there anything I should be looking for when buying an external drive for Plex? Or will any reliable drive do?  Thank you!
1304,One of my cars actually has two forward and down facing cameras  stock options  specifically designed to give you a view of the front lip so you don't ram it into curbs when parking. I sometimes get a minor scrape if I can't exit or enter a ramp at enough of an angle - but it's still rare. You get used to it. I can usually tell if an angle is too much for me to handle safely and if it's questionable I'll find an alternate route or street park. I used to own a 2014 GT that was lowered and that car still had plenty of clearance. I had absolutely no issues - if you are having issues it's not because you lowered the car it's because you have an aftermarket lip on it or something similar. They aren't that low unless you have the wheels tucked up into the wheel wells. lol

1306,You don't know for sure that the oil was overfilled. You could have fuel dilution issues or headgasket or oil cooler issues and be filling the crankcase with a fluid other than oil. You should do an oil change and monitor oil levels as you drive it.
1307,"**First Timer**  Alright so this episode cleared a few things up. First of all it establishes that... the entire economy is theft based? As in  a transaction is ""I take this from you and you take this from me""  with ""take from"" meaning stealing  and thus stealing it back is covered by the three days law? Yeah the Dark Age of the Law prevailed alright [](#heavydrinker)  What I don't get is why Elchi put Jiron into that caravan if it wasn't to foil her dad's plans. And she pretends to not even know herself. Or maybe she doesn't pretend [](#yuishrug)  Also that was 100% a stomache growl sound effect when her Xabungle truck landed.  There've been other pointless scenes as well. Why did they have a rock fall on Jiron's head  just to have him only pretend to be out otherwise? Why did Elchi even go after Jiron only to leave again?  At least I now get that she's trying to take the Iron Guy from her dad. I think. She's too much of an oddball to be sure. But it's definitely convenient that her dad's currently in the process of setting the transformation up so the main guys don't have to.  Jiron also got a lot of strange compliments this episode. Elchi congratulating him on the skill he showed - okay he took out some Walker machines and managed to survive  so I buy it  but it still seemed strange in the situation. And then there was Rag activating the rocket nuzzle and then complimenting Jiron for the results. Certainly didn't flow naturally imo.  Is Blume still gonna try and steal the other Xabungle?  > 1) What do you think of the way of life the people of the Bazaar live?  It's certainly a way of life. Why even have laws at that point if the laws are just ""yeah go ahead do whatever""?  > 2) Do you think the 100 meter transforming landship will be able to move?  They outright said that they already got the transformation working once  didn't they? Besides  they wouldn't have included that idea if they wouldn't make it work  and they especially wouldn't feature the Walker mode so prominently in the OP."
1308,Apple did study on touch ui sizes  I don't remember the exact number but I think it should not be smaller than 0.9cm  at 0.7cm accuracy drops by 25% or so. Screen on which I'm typing this is 6cm wide so 7 columns it's just about the limit.  https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7101858?hl=en  They recommend 7-10mm
1309,"I'm with you til the end where you knock the (useful) dichotomy between combat as sport and combat as war. There IS a meaningful difference between dungeon/adventure design in something like 1e vs something like 4e. As you clearly demonstrated w/ your quotes  the old school RPGs clearly cared about balance.... but you have to remember these were also the RPGs where magic-users started out with 1d4 HP and died (flat out) at 0. These were the RPGs where you regularly could and would encounter groups of enemies that would kill multiple members of the party if the party took them head on.   Like you  I'm super annoyed when people say stuff like ""old school RPGs didn't care about balance""  because that's flat-out wrong. But... it is just as wrong to say they cared about balance in the SAME WAY as a 4e or a 5e. Combat WAS deadlier  and parties WERE expected to avoid it or run away much more often than they are expected to do so in newer editions of D&D.    There IS an expectation in modern editions that the game will flow from balanced combat encounter to balanced combat encounter  with roughly 7-8 normal encounters per long rest. And this IS a difference from older editions. To ignore the differences is to collapse the design space around modern editions of D&D  which is no way to do innovative game design."
1310,My favourite trick is to regularly view the data frame im creating via via a simple interface [import sho  sho.w(df)]  I’m am also militant in ensuring that transformations are done on different dataframe variables so I can visualise each step- especially useful for debugging (versus overwriting within the same variable)  Super simple function to create an html pivotable table (++) from a dataframe via browser.  pip install sho  import sho  sho.w(df)  Not performant for huge data sets  but great for working with simple ~10k tables  Give it a try!!

1311,Yesterday  my dad’s dogs chewed on my laptop charger while i slept. The dogs bit threw a few of the wires in the charger so i had to hold it together in order for it to charge. The last few times i tried to hold the wire together it started to spark. A few hours later while I was watching Youtube  my computer became slow all of the sudden and started freezing. I got a new charger thinking that was the problem but it’s still incredibly slow and USB’s don’t work on it. Please help  i want to know what happened

1314,I really don’t get the the hate-boner people here have for Nvidia  and I also don’t understand this delusion you all are living under where this is “good” for RISCV (when RISCV is still missing core instruction sets that mobile relies on) or will drive adoption. If anything this will only make ARM more attractive because the Mali GPU’s are going away to be replaced by something more competent from Nvidia.   It’s like this whole sub is living under some sort of mass delusion/hysteria.
1315,I see so many people on youtube etc thats acting like this is a giant win and somehow is the nail in the coffin and Death of Fort. Alot of people who dont do research are calling for Fort to stay off of the app store and are creating this thought process in their head where they rewrite the article in saying “Fortnite was removed because of its predatory Microtransactions”  when in reality theres Sooo much more titles out there that WILL take advantage of your child. Theres games out there that are not FREE to access and will still try to Nickel and dime your child. Theres companies that still employ gambling tendencies in their games just for your child to get that one item he or she wants. When in Fort its as simple as you see it  you like it  you buy it  you own it. Compared to others like CoDs You see it  you like it  spin the slot machine  didnt get it? Try again you have X amount of chances left to get the item but the catch is the cost to try is going to keep going up”. Seriously Fortnite is not as bad as people make it out to be and lets be honest most people that hate Fort its not because of the Item Shop or “Microtransactions” its simply because they have something against Fortnite for being as big as it is for some freakin reason so they all jump on the band wagon to hate it. These people are most likely the same people who cry “Fortnite Killer” everytime another someteenth hundred battle royale game comes out.
1316,For novels  I'd recommend checking out Jack Vance's *Dying Earth* series and Gene Wolfe's *The Book of the New Sun * both set in the far  far distant future when the sun is failing and technology has become magic.  Jack Vance's series inspired the spell-casting mechanics of D&D.  There's an old *Dying Earth* RPG from 15 or 20 years ago and a DCC campaign setting is supposed to be coming out soon.  There's also a GURPS supplement for *The Book of the New Sun*.  More tangentially  Frank Herbert's *Dune* and Dan Simmons' *Hyperion Cantos* (and sequels) are sci-fi novels in which society has become fairly medieval again (the *Hyperion Cantos* is a re-telling of the Canterbury tales).  There's also Edgar Rice Burrough's *Barsoom* series  which involves sword fights and airships on Mars  On the fantasy side   the *Wheel of Time* is set in the far distant future (or is it the far distant past?) with the occasional mysterious relic being unearthed.  The *Malazan Book of the Fallen* also features mysterious devices from earlier  more advanced civilizations.  On TV  *Thundarr the Barbarian* and *Adventure Time* might provide some science fantasy inspiration.  On the RPG side  *Tékumel* and *Ultraviolet Grasslands* are science fantasy settings.  The setting of UVG is left fairly undefined  while *Tékumel* is *very* thought out—inspired by south asian and middle eastern cultures  the  setting is certainly *different*  but not eclectic.   Though still in beta  there's also *Worlds without Number*  a sandbox fantasy companion to *Stars without Number*.  Inspired by Wolfe's novels  it has lots of GM tools for generating science fantasy artifacts  cultures  and terrain.  The default setting is science fantasy (it reminded me of a toned-down *Numenara*) and will receive a more detailed supplement once the core game is finished.

1319,"I can think of a few reasons  and apologies if I end up repeating what others have said:  1. DnD was the OG of RPGs.  It codified many of the tropes and concepts involved in RPGs  and for a long time it had no significant competition.  This led to DnD becoming a 'generic trademark "" in which people will use the term when discussing the entire industry.  The same way some people will call any video game ""Nintendo"" or any soda drink a ""Coke "" people will refer to any RPG as ""DnD "" often without even being aware that other games exist. 2. DnD was able to branch out from just being an RPG game into other media.  It fueled the tabletop miniatures industry to a great extent  had a shitty Saturday morning TV show  an even shittier movie  and published a successful series of novels.  (I suspect - with zero evidence to back it up - that more people read Dragonlance novels than ever actually played the game.)  Appearances in media like 'Stranger Things' have also fueled public awareness of DnD.  Other games have tried to expand into different media (like Shadowrun and Vampire) but had much less success. 3. In the late 90's  TSR was losing money.  They were in a creative slump and the gaming industry in general was growing stagnant.  So TSR was bought by WOTC  which was in turn acquired by toy industry juggernaught Hasbro.  THEN  they had an a stroke of genius:  They would publish DnD 3rd edition  which would completely revamp the rules and art style  and also make the D20 system universally available.  **The D20 System hit the RPG industry like a nuclear bomb.**  The closest analogy I can make is to compare it to the moment Kenner introduced Star Wars toys or the first time accountants got their hands on VisiCalc.  The D20 System was wildly popular.  Every company was publishing D20 content  some of which was/is even better than the original.  Massive properties like 'Star Wars' had D20 RPGs.  (Anyone who played the KOTOR video games knows how the D20 system works  even if they have never played DnD.)  Nowadays the D20 system has kind of a bad rep because it led to a lot of amateurs publishing shitty content  but at the time it was an absolute renaissance in gaming."

1321,I've seen a few SOL and sports anime but I particularly enjoyed this one. It didn't hesitate to address some really heavy subject matter while also having some levity in the interactions between the kids.

1323,Hey all   I recently graduated with a masters studying Bioinformatics. I’ve been job hunting for the better part of a year and unfortunately the job market for Bioinformatics is pretty limited here in Austin. That being said  I’d like to see about getting into data science since data science is a large component of Bioinformatics (genome analysis and statistical genetics for examples). Would any data science hiring manager like to review my resume and maybe give me some feedback on how I can be more lucrative to recruiters/managers hiring junior (entry level) data scientist? DM me if you’re interested.
1324,I find it interesting  that GN released it after receiving the RTX 3080. We know this because it's posted after everyone posting their unboxing. I'll take fault in reading too much into this  but why would GN create a pundit video on AMD unless they know a very good point was coming. That the nVidia performance numbers were good enough for GN to tell AMD  be better.  This is in addition to Jayztwocent also coming out with a video  I know it's one day before his unboxing video post but still he kindly jab at AMD by saying [he also doesnt think AMD will beat nVidia](https://youtu.be/nXraA_5L_9g?t=545).   Then Linus Tech Tips comments on his recent WAN show. At one part of the show he commented he's seen the numbers of 3080  but he cant say anything about it. But later on commenting on AMD that he would gladly be wrong but AMD is just [not competitive](https://youtu.be/0CRN5_eOQgc?t=4541).  AMD is announcing their Zen 3 first then 20 days later  almost a month  announce Big Navi. Their threat is nVidia with graphics. Everyone knows their processors will beat Intel  so why announce CPU first unless you want to create good publicity before a possible let down. You would think that if you want to make a statement you face off with nVidia first  because if you hit it out of the ball park  you now own graphics and cpu. To me announcing CPU first is a flinch.
1325,They nit picked the hell out of it. It wasn’t a BMW so it sucked. Even though it undercuts the price of a BMW by at least 10k for slightly less performance.  The car is fine and will be a great option for people who want a good ride and some on ramp performance.
1326,Your placement constants in constructor are incorrect. Call this after player is created:      player.placeAt(player.tileFrom[0]  player.tileFrom[1])   If you rearrange code a bit you will be able to call it in constructor.
1327,"Check out The Burning Wheel. It takes some investment from the players but you will create in-depth characters who feel connected to the world through the choices you've made  and the options are many.

1328,I go to your average high school. We’ve got students from all different incomes. Homeless kids to borderline trust fund kids.  Most of the cars in the lot are Japanese and American economy cars. The upper middle class kids typically drive their parents ‘old’ car that was considered pretty nice like 6 years ago. Lots of American crossovers  quite a few German cars too. The rich kids drive the car they want.   Here’s what’s cool among boys.  - Wranglers  - Mustangs  - Camaros  - Chargers (surprisingly few challengers)  - BMW sports cars  - Teslas  - Pickup Trucks   Here’s what’s cool among girls  - Wranglers  - German luxury  - American luxury (Cadillac/Lincoln)  - Lexus  - VW beetles  - Jeep Grand Cherokees (I don’t know why)
1329,So  as per title  I'd like to expand my C: drive  as the space is not that much on the drive itself.  I managed to remove a recovery partition (was created by the system)  and now I have those 15 3GB of unallocated space.  Reading around I found out that if the volumes aren't contiguous (like C: and the 260MB one) I'll not be able to do so.  Then I'm asking  is there a way for me to move the empty space  next to the C: one?

1331,Hey everyone   My sister-in-law is a big fan of the For The Queen RPG  and I want to get her a similar game for Christmas.   For those who haven't played it  it is a game where you basically improvise a story together about this Queen and your relationship to her. Played by 2+ players. You pick a queen (just a card with art of a queen) and then on each turn  you draw a card. The card asks something about your history with the Queen (The queen hates your hobby. Why?) and you can answer it with whatever you want. That's really about it. There are some rules regulating what you can and can't say  and for when the game ends  but they're minimal.   She likes that it is collaborative (you often build off of each other's answers)  role-playing (you make up your fictional position within the Queen's court  like Master of the Hunt)  and very rules-light. Also  the length  which is 30-60 minutes.  Any ideas?
1332,"You could work foresight backwards  kind of like the flashback mechanism in Blades in the Dark. Your team come across a werewolf - ""aw shit"" - ""it's okay  I saw into the future and knew we would need these"" (unpacks silver tipped arrows). Just something to make your the time meddler seem as if they knew this was going to happen."
1333,You asked about finance and banking  but I can give you an example in healthcare. I work in healthcare for a F10 company. I'm talking about the US healthcare system.  There are entire divisions of health insurance companies that are called 'Payment Integrity'  which usually house a team specifically dedicated to healthcare Fraud  Waste  and Abuse (FWA).  In the Payment Integrity world  no one really focuses on fraud because it's hard to detect  hard to prove  has a lot of business risk  and pays $0. (If you throw someone in prison for fraud  they are likely not going to be able to pay you back.)  PI would rather focus on identifying incorrect billing (billed the wrong payer and/or billed the wrong amount) and get a % based commission on correcting those mistakes (it's a multi billion dollar industry). But incorrect billing isn't fraud  it's honest/lazy mistakes.... most of the time.  Even if we delve into healthcare fraud  rules + SME's are much more cost-effective at finding fraud than data science models. Noteworthy fraud schemes (that is  schemes worth taking down) are novel  which means they are pretty hard to model.  Otherwise  standard dynamic rules-based 'expected ranges' work fine to flag anomalies which then legitimately require a nuanced healthcare expert to inspect.  (Accusing someone of fraud isn't something you're just going to automate!)  Most healthcare fraud isn't identified by a model but because of the human element.... someone gets a kickback  someone submits a tip  someone gets jealous  etc and contacts the authorities. Authorities can actually move on something where someone can testify as fraudulent intent. It's hard to do that with a model.    Overall  most ML models/rules I've seen that try to detect healthcare fraud just end up having a shit load of false positives that really just up identifying really  really sick patients..... patients that would require abnormally high levels of care  subsequently triggering abnormally high costs of care  thus abnormal amounts of billing that would be flagged by an anomaly model. This doesn't help the business at all in identifying fraud.  Healthcare fraud exists  for sure  but most of the time it isn't detected via a model  it's just standard due diligence and humans being humans.
1334,Not sure for a fan base as an entirety  but it appears r/mustang is fine with imitating higher trim level cars. For example  making an EcoBoost look like a Shelby  and it passing as badass. This would never pass in the BMW community

1336,>The only real stipulation is that it has to be fantasy. Or  at least  not sci-fi.

1338,I really depends on the game itself  and the contacts you have for potential interested parties.  If it's a compelling product (which as  [u/r0bbyboy](https://www.reddit.com/user/r0bbyboy/) implies  is difficult in just a few months)  you might be able to negotiate in the 4 figures.  There are certainly examples of great web games made in even just a few weeks (Canabalt comes to mind)  but that is not an example to live by.  One advantage of web games is that there is a lower barrier to entry for new players. Establishing a userbase would be a way to show that the game has value.

1340,I can't remember all the mechanics  especially during combat. I've looked up the grapple mechanics a thousend times and I keep forgetting things like that. Or get blindsided about how crazily fast my Tabaxi Rogue player can move in one turn. Things I KNOW  or should know after DM'ing for a year and a half.
1341,$449 is a great price for the PS5  slightly undercutting the Series X. $400 for the Digital Edition is way too much though  doesn't really justify being just $50 less when you can't use used games  play PS4 discs or watch Blurays. IMO it should be $349  since Sony will recoup The initial lower price over the years through exclusive digital purchases.
1342,Lol at “the next tier.” A 30k V6 Challenger to a Maserati GT is about 6 tiers.   It sounds to me like you just need to pick a better middle ground. There’s a lot of flash to every car you picked- so much that I’m shocked you even consider them feeling the way you do. Get yourself into a nice sport sedan like an M or an AMG.
1343,Boss expresses their disinterest in developing you as an employee to your face (this has actually happened to me).   Especially when new  any boss that expresses impatience or an annoyance at spending time with you to teach you (or having a very competent coworker take that on) is pretty much always a nightmare.
1344,I actually bought second hand rs3 from 2015 for this very reason  the dash and cockpit is so clean. All I need is a speedo  rev counter and fuel gauge in the cluster really. Having real buttons for climate control  traction control is simply required. Large touch screens should never need to be used for anything during driving.  I can accept a large screen from a phone or the dash for some things such sat nav as that is something you operate before setting off and bigger is better  but I absolutely love being able to get rid of these as distractions when not using them  keeping only audio alerts for hazards from the sat nav.
1345,Didn't see any speed cameras apart from the warning signs. Guess they just use the police car patrols to catch people... I love driving around in Norfolk   although it's lot flatter than I like it has some good driving roads. The A149 Cromer to Hunstanton along the coast is very nice  although I believe it does have a few speed cameras now but it's a road you don't have to speed much to enjoy.
1346,Satoshi Kon's works have a more realistic style  [and girls have more detailed noses than usual](https://www.courte-focale.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paprika-Kon_0-1024x576.jpg) (still stylised)   And (some) manga artists can [draw nice looking girls with noses that aren't just a dot](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/98/24/f0/9824f08b3bd5a905856917bdf8abd73a.png)  it's just that it's more difficult and time consuming to go for a more semi-realistic style.

1350,Since it's had multiple electrical issues you might try cleaning all of the grounds since that can cause oddball issues like that. Especially since they suspected a bad wiring harness twice.  I've had a bad ground take out the radiator fan and an entire headlight intermittently  as well as hvac module  coolant temp gauge  and instrument cluster display on a different car.
1351,I like the aesthetic. I'm a little confused how the art   and rules communicates though  it cant settle wheter this is superhero  like avengers / captain america  or more soldier-y.  Also  I feel like this would fit much better in Savage Worlds than D&D  but the market being as it is I can understand going with 5e.
1352,To me it is obvious that Square got completely backed up because of FFXIII and all of its side projects which ultimately included FFXV. We also can't forget that technically XIV was release only a couple of years after XIII. But after XV got out Kingdom Hearts III came out a few years after then then this year FFVII Remake came out. So I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this was a Holiday 2021 release. If it's already been in development for 4 years then I think it'd be close to finishing next year.
1353,"Mythological accuracy.  I've been a student of classical civilisations and mythology  and one thing that always bugs me is when myths like the greek ones are depicted.....wrong.  By which I mean - lets take Heracles for example. First  far too many versions name him Hercules. ugh. Second  the purpose of his existence was never to ""be a great hero to inspire the world"" or nonsense like that. His purpose was ""prophect says Titans are coming back  we need you to kill them"".  Like most Greek heroes  their purpose is ordained by Zeus to rid the world of monsters. To literally get rid of the mytholigical monsters entirely  so that mankind would have the world to themselves.  But so few depictions of the myths touch on that in any way  even though it was the whole point of most of the myths."
1354,A good trap is like a good riddle  it needs context.  The Jewel of Atlantis episode from the Ducktales reboot is a wonderful trap. All the clues and solution are presented within the context of the adventure  the context of the temple dungeon.  A trap doesn't have to be created  it could just be a consequence of decay and lack of maintenance. A trap doesn't even have to be hidden  it can be blatant and obvious.   A load bearing pillar may be partially collapsed and be held together by the macguffin the party is seeking. Move the macguffin and the pillar crumbles  releasing its load and dropping a mass of dirt and stone across the doorway. It's a trap for the unwary or rushed but is obvious to anyone paying attention and easy to bypass for those with patience and care.
1355,Hey all   I  was curious what advice I could get from people familiar with Masters  in Data Science / Bridge to Computer Science programs and what they  would think of my profile. I’m very much so “swinging for the fences”  and may have my sights set too high on programs that are too competitive  for my profile. **If anyone knows  of a graduate program they’d like to suggest to me that they think I’d  have a better chance of success at  please send it my way.**  Also   I’m not looking for research / thesis track programs  but rather  looking for a professional degree that will help me pivot my career from  finance into Data Science.  **Profile Stats:**  * Personal: White / Male / US Citizen * Undergrad School – Decently ranked large state school * Undergrad Major: Finance * Undergrad GPA: 3.65 * Prerequisites  for CS / DS – I have all the prerequisites (Calc I&II  Stats  Lin  Algebra I  Intro to CS) for the programs listed below  completed with an  A/A- average. Unfortunately  this is as far as my technical background  goes.  **Test Scores:**  * GRE: V 164 (94% Percentile) * Q 168 (92% Percentile) * AWA 5.0 (92% Percentile)  **Work Experience:**  * Internship  at analytics department – became very proficient with Alteryx  Tableau  and Power BI. Started learning Python at the end of it. * 1.5yrs  as a Financial Analyst – several high impact projects that look good on  my resume. Lots of facetime with senior management explaining business  impacts of whatever data I’m working with.  **LORS:**  1  from an old professor  2 from internship at analytics department. I  have a great relationship with all of the people writing my LORs  so I  think that these will be as good as I can get.  **Schools - Programs:**  * University of Washington – Masters in Data Science * NYU – Masters in Data Science * University of Chicago - Masters in Data Science * University of San Francisco - Masters in Data Science * Brown – Masters in Data Science * Georgia Tech – Masters in Analytics * Northwestern – Masters in Analytics * MIT – Masters in Business Analytics * Carnegie Mellon University – Masters in Data Science * Carnegie Mellon University – Masters in CS (Extended Track) * Columbia – Masters in CS (Bridge Program)  What do y’all think? Am I competitive for any of these programs?  Before  I get hit with “Just look at the class profile stats” – I have already  done so and am familiar with the average GPAs  test scores  and  undergrad backgrounds. What I’m looking for here is to receive any  advice / opinions from people familiar with the above programs (or any  programs for CS/DS) specifically in relation to my non-STEM background.  Again – any advice and feedback is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
1356,This is a partial repost of a thread yesterday. $12k just for the motor.  You will still need to spend another $25k for everything else.  This isn't a simple DC motor swap   were you can ebay golf cart parts.  This is an AC motor   and requires a lot of expensive parts.    Were I can go to my junk yard and get a L9H (truck version LS3) for $350. I can leave with pretty much everything I'd need (transmission   ecu  tcm  etc) for around $1 000  This Tesla motor swap thing.... it's not a thing.  LS swaps area far too practical

1360,Aces & Eights: Reloaded  Has life path generation  is based on actual history instead of the “cowboys with spells” deadlands kind of stuff  and easily has some of the most inventive mechanics I’ve seen in my many years of tabletop gaming.  Want to run cattle drive? A saloon? Prospect? Run literally any old west business? Bounty hunt? Homestead? Banditry? Stagecoach management? All of that and more than I can comfortably type is in A&E.  Edit: whoops  didn’t read the whole post and saw A&E was already mentioned. I would say if you only read the first edition  check out Reloaded as the life path may have changed and better suits your needs. At any rate  I love the system and wish more people knew about it.
1361,Maybe not quite what you’re asking  but I’ve started up a Genealogy-based data science / ML project  to work on my skills.   Basically  for between the years 1790-1880  for three counties in North Carolina  I want to use (1) U.S. Federal Census data  (2) birth records  (3) death records  (4) probate and will records  (5) land records  (6) tax records  and (7) court records to identify social networks to solve questions like  “who is the father of X?”  when no records exist that state who Xs father is.   It’s gonna be fun.
1362,While at first I thought this was a dumb question  I think there's a reasonable answer:  3  SQL + 2 other languages.  Why two?  When you learn your first programming language  you are going to learn a lot of generic concepts (loops  conditional statements  exception handling  functions  recursion  etc.) *but with that language's syntax*. What that can often lead to is a focus on mechanics more than a true understanding of what these things are doing  i.e.  you may get really comfortable just using a function in R that does something without actually truly understanding what it does. Or why it's efficient. Or inefficient.  Learning a 2nd programming language - and really any language will do - forces you to a) learn how to learn a new programming language when you're already rooted in a first one  and b) focus on what is really happening when you code  because you won't be able to translate things from one language to the other easily.  So  for example  you start off learning Python. And you get really comfortable with numpy arrays and all the nice functionalities they come with. You may actually forget that numpy arrays are at some level just arrays with a whole bunch of functions  methods  etc. built on top of them.  So you move to R and now you want to deal with arrays. But R arrays are a little bit different  and have different functionalities. They are also different in that R doesn't really focus as much on arrays as it does on data.frames. So not only do you need to learn the R syntax for arrays  you need to actually focus on whether or not arrays are the right data structure to use for the problem at hand.
1363,If it's just for the last session  give each player three [Domains](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/). Give them a list to choose from  otherwise you'll end up with more than you can handle i.e. Time Domain.  Then go for a rock paper scissor system. If it's a tie  and the action is covered by their Domain  they win. Otherwise they lose. Maybe add in some Divine Action points based on number of believers/conquests that offer rerolls  bonus actions  or tie breakers.  If you're looking to turn this into a full campaign  try something like [Nobilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobilis). The D&D wargaming paradigm isn't exactly prepared to handle godhood. The closest I've seen is the 3.5 D&D rules for Deities and Demigods  where the bonuses are so ridiculous the d20 no longer matters except on a 1 or 20.

1365,I could see this being useful for cases where you want to be able to play immediately when your physical copy arrives or if your friend is coming over with theirs.  Preloading games on a good connection when you have no or a shitty connection at where you’re going to be or live.  Also the scenario where you are on the fence about a game and just want it ready to go in the event you do pull the trigger.  Neat feature overall.
1366,Hey all   I'm creating my first game which is just a command line based play money poker game. My development experience is mainly web development based experience so I'm familiar with REST architecture and how JSON is sent over HTTP to communicate between server/client.  For this game  I'm using TCP to establish a realtime connection between the server and client. One thing I don't quite grasp is how to construct my game related messages. I understand that once I've a connection between the server and client  I can take something as simple a string  convert it to bytes  and send this string from the client to the server. The server will receive this byte array and can then convert it to a string.  Now if I want to process player actions  do I essentially need to create my own data format? My first instinct  based on my experience  is to serialize/deserialize game messages using JSON:      {       action: 'check'     }     {       action: 'bet'       amount: 10     }     {       action: 'fold'     }  Or would I make my own data format?      action:bet:10\n     action:check     action:fold          func parseAction(action []byte) {        ...     }          action := parseAction(actionMessage)          switch action {       case ACTIONS_BET:         handleBet       case ACTIONS_CHECK:         handleCheck       case ACTIONS_FOLD:         handleFold     }  of course for poker it doesn't need to be that complicated  this could be as simple as sending strings and using a switch statement  but I'm also curious are more complex games handle this.
1367,I think the changing technology are how games like that become in development for that long. The announcement of the game is just the revealing of the idea/project being worked on so it can be announced at any time. But then as development works on the game things change. They could’ve spent 2-3 years working on it only for a big industry change in graphics making it easier and then have to go back and recreate or change everything to match that standard. I think it’s fair to say that big projects depending on scale can easily take 5+ years. Any changes in industry that happen during that time just further delay it unexpectedly.

1370,Honestly I think that USB4 is going to solve most of that.  The new naming scheme is much simpler  the icons are easier to understand.  And we will finally not have to worry about USB vs Thunderbolt.  Everything will just work  and the only thing that people will have to deal with is shitty companies that include USBC ports that don't have displayport or PD (looking at YOU HP)  which  now that's it's getting MUCH cheaper to implement is becoming much less of a problem.

1372,What an absolute shit show today was. DDoSed during the only 20 minutes it was even available on most websites.

1375,"In our homebrew world we liked the idea of non evil necromancers so we created some structure for them. Both were concerned with passing of Souls to the afterlife and only used bodies of people that agreed or were condemned to the fate of undeath  as a sort of penance or reward.  One was called Brothers of Saint Villes. They fought with weapons that look somewhat like moon spades  used undead sinners as servants and warriors to fight ""evil"" undead like vampires  ghosts and other stuff like that.  The second was a whole state ruled by an undead god kin  a high priest of the Pale Lord  a god of the Afterlife. Nadar Abad was a place were people didn't fear death and once a year the dead came back to life to celebrate with their lost loved ones. Because of that medicine  and biology were very well developed in this place.  You could also look up Hollowfaust City of Necromancers. It is a sourcebook for Scarred Lands a dnd setting from Onyx Path Publishing."
1376,I would suggest two programs for you  as you are working (I think I read that in one of your replies..) you can go for an online Masters program that you will get a full Masters like the on campus one  with the SAME diploma: 1- Georgia Institute of Technology  “Masters of Science in Computer Science” (OMSCS)  they have a diploma with “Masters of Science in Analytics” (OMSA)  very good price ~ 10 000$ in total. 2- University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Masters of Computer Science (MCS)  and they have a “Data Science” track.  Note: UT Austin is a well known University
1377,Turn your datasets into tables and then add them to the data model in excel. Then in the data model you can create relationships between your datasets.

1383,The *Warships* sourcebook for the old Alternity RPG was pretty good for both ship-building and starship combat. Lots of things for different players to do besides pilot & shoot. Different tech trees and tech levels can help customize to your preferred setting.   I also like the system from Stars Without Number  which gives each player at the table something interesting to do  and can be grafted onto another system/setting with a small amount of work. And I always liked the simplicity of Star Wars Saga starship combat  which worked pretty closely to personal combat (and some feats even worked the same for ships vs. people).
1384,">I am all in for having dangers to be deadly  but to encounter something that instantly kills my players is not my cup of tea.      If the atmosphere you are going for is horror  it is a very good idea (on a different day I might say ""necessary"") to have at least one if not several enemies that are un-killable through orthodox means (this can also be a horde  ex zombies) and that can one shot any PC. It is one of the only truly proven ways to create a sense of dread in players  which is one reason games set in the Cthulhu-verse are so popular.       If you want an action atmosphere  it still isn't a bad idea but it has slightly less function there  but then you might as well just run ""D&D in space"" because one thing D&D is very good at is heroic power fantasy.       If you are really wanting to run Genesys  d20Radio has an ALIEN setting [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genesysrpg/comments/8a1nou/alien_genesys_setting/) that might be of interest."
1385,"Two things:  First  you don't have to a ready ""why"" for everything. If you look around  plenty of things you dont' understand  no reason to assume the players should have better.  Second  the writing advice ""kill all your little darlings"" applies here. In your case  its your need to have created the world and documented *every* step.  You DO NOT have to do that. Things can just *be*.    After a while  the must-justify-everything version of world building leads to never actually running the game because there is a never-ending supply of questions that need thought and a why.  Think of your world like a Western movie lot.  The story requires that the bar and the boarding house is fleshed out  has characters  and has a full interior map and makes logical sense.  Same with the sheriff's office.   But the blacksmith's shop?  The general store?  Just needs to be the storefront. No need to acutally build the interior of the store. That's why movie studio sets are often just fronts and only places where *story* happens gets interior sets.  So make a movie town and improvise when they go where you don't expect. Spend the time you save on the campaign  the story  the players  and planning for contingencies of what the players are likely to do  rather than filling in details they will never see or ask about.    Literally  you don't get extra points for completion and as long as you are reasonably consistent  you don't need explanations for everything how the world works.  Hope that helps!"
1386,Palm Springs  CA  I’m looking to buy a used car but I’m stuck between how I should go about it. Would really appreciate some help.  Budget is 10-11k   Option 1: go to a rental company and buy one of their used cars. It would be a newer model for a cheap price and low miles. I would consider a Hyundai Elantra or a Toyota if one is available around that price but most likely not. All the cars are 2017 or newer.    Option 2: go to a local dealer or private sale and try to find a really good car without being ripped off. Where I live most of the population is old retired people or rich snow birds. You can find some gems like Lexus  old Toyota  Azeras  genesis  and Avalon’s but it’s hard to find. The issue with them is they’re really old 10+ years guaranteed  and they have a lot of mileage. Minimum is like 70k but normal is around 110k.    To the point: should I buy a used rental car that has fewer miles and is a newer model or should I get an old car with 100k+ miles for the same price. One is a rental  the other belonged to an old person who probably only drove it like 7K miles a year.
1387,"Hi  hoping to get some advice on switching to a data **analyst** career for my specific situation. It's a bit of a read so I appreciate ya'll who make it to the end.   So  I was recently laid off from a major tech company where I worked in Operations for 5 years. Most of my time there was spent doing a sort of hybrid of project management  process development  and brand risk management. The work that was most fulfilling in this time was centered around creative problem solving and flexing my analytical muscles. Unfortunately  this did not occupy the bulk of my time and was largely left wanting for something more fulfilling so the layoff wasn't entirely a bad thing.   On recommendation of a career counselor  I have started to look into data analytics as a new path. I am wondering if this path seems like a solid choice for someone with my background. Some other info that helps inform who I am as a worker:  &#x200B   * 33 years of age      * BS in Sociology     * Loves spreadsheets. From that feeling when you get a complicated formula to work to creating and maintaining an aesthetically pleasing organizational system.      * Happy to work alone but also look for opportunities to collaborate or be an ""expert"" as part of a project     * Questions everything and a consistent problem solving mindset     * Great at researching and finding answers     * Gets a lot of satisfaction in being helpful to peers and often deliver on requests quicker than expected      * Dives deeper into things I am passionate about than most peers would     * Obsessive over details but also take pride in being able to zoom out and see the bigger picture     * Much prefer collaboration to competition      I know data can be an incredibly lucrative career but money is not a driving factor for me. I would much rather be doing work with greater social good than a bigger paycheck. That and if a smaller paycheck means I have to spend less time being productive and I can focus on other parts of my life  all the better.   Thanks for any input!"
1388,You could get a well optioned 718 in whatever your flavor for that price.       Like  I get that this is a special variant and likely not a lot of people would go for it regardless...but shit  it still seems like shitty price gouging.
1389,Consumer reports breaks down problem spots by year. The engine isn't known for major or minor issues and has top marks. Seems the lowest ratings relate to paint/trim  electronics  and transmission (which I think is due to the A8). The camaro is assembled in the USA for this generation.  Personally never had any issues with my M6 2SS and it was very early 2016. Engine runs perfect so far.
1390,Clean your maf every few months. Ecu is super picky with that and any vacuum leaks. Intake manifold gaskets leaks and throws a lean code sometimes. Injector o rings should probably be checked. Besides that just normal maintenance. Wouldn't be a bad idea to change your timing chain and water pump but they have lasted well over 400k original. Solid ass car
1391,Honestly  either would work well for a six month student project. If you're afraid of blindly commiting to one  try making a small project in both (nothing you would spend more than a week's worth of work on). After you're done  pick the one your team felt most productive using.
1392,Also programming/IT computing has become a commodity in the past decade.  Add to it cheap labor / cost effective option offshoring has made life as a techie in US miserable (I experienced this 1st hand).    I would look into how you can repurpose your skills that's in need.  I took the route of IT/Corporate strategy to reinvent myself.  I think it will be a nichie for next 5 or so years before the outsourcing crowd gets into it and make is less of a unique skill.
1393,"Why are you ""low-key"" curious... Having an interest in how a nuclear vehicle would work is nothing you need to be discreet about. Which in case you didn't know  that's what ""low-key"" means. I'm not at all ""low-key"" pissed at how modern trendy phrases come about. They almost never apply to what's being said.  Sorry for the rant."
1394,[**I saw the other submission on the Focus RS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/j2tqi4/15_years_of_owning_a_cpo_focus_rs) and decided to do a write-up for my ownership with the Fiesta ST  as I've had a completely different experience with my Ford.  I have a 2017 model  purchased brand new in September 2017. The 2017 has improved cooling over the 2014s and 2015s  as well as a revised PVC system to reduce carbon buildup.  I specifically chose the 2017 model because this was my first Ford and I was concerned about the reliability  so I wanted the updated cooling. I also chose the Fiesta ST over the Focus ST in part due to better reliability  and also because the Fiesta ST was simply far more fun to drive (and stock for stock  the FoST really didn't seem all that much faster  even though on paper it's a full half second to 60 faster).  Mine currently has 58k miles on it  and I've been tuned since 3k miles.  Tuned by Stratified  with all the options available. On a single tune  I have 5 separate map slots (91/93/E30/Eco/Valet) that I can switch between within a few seconds. Although I mostly use 93 or E30  the 91 map came in handy on huge road trip that I went on all over the Western portion of the US (Colorado  Glacial National Park  etc). It's also handy to have on hot days  when I run 93 octane on the 91 map to further reduce knocking. Eco mode cuts boost in half (12lbs or so) and basically turns the car into a Corolla. Valet mode cuts boost down to 5lbs and limits RPMs to 3k. I only use this when I get the car inspected every year  as kids doing the inspection on the car practically salivate at the prospect of doing some hooning. This stops them from doing that.  Speaking of heat  even though I do have the 2017 model  there have been a handful of overheating issues while sitting in traffic during 105-110F days. I installed a Mountune radiator which took care of this. At least where I live  the updated cooling on the 2017 did not benefit me. The stock radiator on these cars really needs to be trashed and replaced with a better unit. Interestingly  it never overheated on E30 fuel  despite making more power. It only overheated on the 91/93 maps. E30 burns at a cooler temperature so I guess that helped.   Like all Fiesta ST owners  both of my blend door actuators failed. Mine went around 30k miles or so  and I haven't bothered to fix them because the ventilation system still works as normal. If I keep the foot option on the ventilation engaged  the clicking only lasts a few seconds at startup.  Aside from overheating issues and the few seconds of clicking sounds  I haven't had any issues at all with the car. Car has been tuned for 55k miles now  pushing 26-27lbs of boost (stock is 18ish). Oil and filter changed every 5k with Pennzoil 5w30 full synthetic. Plugs changed every 10k miles (yes I know that's excessive  tuner calls for 20k intervals and I cut that in half).  **Mods are as follows:** Whoosh intercooler  Cobb AP3 with Stratified tune  
1395,really impressed. thought the CGI was a *little* jarring but honestly  this show and demon slayer have shown that CGI can be pulled off and i really enjoyed the mech fight. it had great choreography and the comically villainous guy in the machine was pretty funny
1396,This whole getting ripped off by service departments and mechanics is exactly why I recommend buying /leasing cars  when you can comfortably afford to do so   I haven’t spent more then $1000 in the last 15 years on repairs   Haven’t spent a dime on tires     If u add up the costs  it doesn’t cost much more to just keep getting a new car every 3 years  +\-
1397,"I don't want to go full r/cars and go ""CVT IN SPORTS CAR WAHHHHHHH"" but why? Why put a cvt in a car that they committed for ""sportiness"". I know manuals won't sell  but even the 8 Speed with the pedals would've been a better choice."
1398,I believe more people are going to use subscription-like services rather than owning a car.   Of course  enthusiasts and collectors are still going to want to own their cars  and the used market is not going away  but I think buying a new car is going to become less common.
1399,The # of cards scalped being only 4 is not accurate. There are at least 16 cards that were scalped due to removed links. Here are 11x 3090s that were also sold at inflated prices [link](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MSI-GeForce-RTX-3090-GAMING-X-TRIO-24G-Graphics-Card-PCI-E-Gen-4-VR-Ready/143753901768?hash=item21786676c8:g:754AAOSwrgVfbM92)
1400,I am doing the MS CS program via JHU and have taken data science courses. I would say the MS DS program is quite rigorous and balances both CS and Stats courses well.      However  I don't think it is worth the $50k tuition unless your company is paying for you. Data Science is still a new degree and not very well respected yet. It is much more preferable to do a MS CS degree with data science specialization. This way you can pivot to another CS career (software  cybersecurity  etc...) if data scientist doesn't work out in the future. That is why I am in the CS program instead of the DS program.
1401,Apologies if this isn't the right sub for this. I am trying to run an elastic-net regression in r studio  however when I try to train my model I am finding NAs in elastic\_model$results. The NAs crops up when my RMSE is a certain value. I suspect this is a collinearity problem but can't figure out how to trace it back to my problem variables (> 50).   Any ideas?
1402,Dell G5 SE    https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/dell-g5-15-se-gaming-laptop/spd/g-series-15-5505-laptop/gn5505eidnh?view=configurations  Acer Helios 300  https://www.newegg.com/black-acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-entertainment/p/1TS-000X-026T5?item=9SIAJNJC0S8716   Need a new gaming laptop and these two are the ones I've narrowed down. Do you guys think the Acer with worth more the price? I mostly play MMOs or older steam games as I'm mainly a PlayStation gamer.
1403,I don't shame you for asking that  everyone has their own preferences and opinions  after all  but I am simply curious: Why do you not want the anime to be older than 2010 or so? Does it have to do with graphics quality or perhaps some trends from way back then that you dislike?
1404,Hi  im on ios 13.7 and all the anime apps dont have this show called ‘’the files of young kindaichi’’ its really underrated and all the anime apps i searched dont have it now my question is where do i watch anime on ios that probably has that anime?
1405,So all you've done here is show two pictures  not even overlaid  and without dimensions? Aight.  That aside  you're just looking at pictures with no idea about actual densities. This is really nothing of value  I'm sorry to say. At least  not without some real analysis that won't be possible until we have the chips and know more about them.
1406,"Sounds like bs (from them) and they likely had an internal candidate already lined up  or just couldn't be bothered to supply actual feedback. I went to 30+ interviews like that last year and heard all the excuses under the sun from hiring managers. Best one was not having a high enough stack overflow rating  yet they never asked for my profile! Just keep applying and in the interim  build your own data science projects  register with contract agencies and see if you can land some of your own. Working for ""the man"" should only be a fallback option  as most corporate data science advertisements are nothing like the reality of the role which is often a department struggling to justify itself  poorly equipped  toiling for rapidly promoted managers riding a tsunami of hype."
1407,"£180-200 for a 1TB NVMe SSD in 2020 stings.  I know it's ""gen 4 fast af boiii""  but I for sure don't need that speed and would much rather buy 2 1TB SN550s for that price.  See you in 3-5 years when prices are slightly better and the speeds are slightly more necessary."
1408,It fully depends. I have had some applications where I needed to write and optimize low-level code for some really unique tasks where there weren't pre-made algorithms. But if there is a pre-made thing  I'd usually use it.  Everyone's job is different  but the place where I get to express more coding creativity is in program structure. Designing libraries to automate out repeated tasks  or creating templates for various objects using class inheritance  or interfacing with various backend technologies in clever ways. These aren't quite the same as the things you mention in your post  but they represent another aspect of coding in data science.  Writing good  clean  documented  version-controlled code is very important in DS.

1410,"Has anyone seen a product or DIY project like this?  Like a clear  see-thru ruler but marked in 10 ft increments and shaded to portray the visual ranges for the light source you're using.  So if you were carrying a torch  the first 2 inches (20') of the ruler are clear but the next 20' are partially shaded with the word  ""DIM"" written on it.  I know it's overkill but would be very helpful for the new players in a complex fight in the dark where some PCs have darkvision and some have light sources."
1411,This game is awesome and on my list to buy but I'm gonna wait for the DX12 update  because DX11 for a severely CPU bound game in late 2020  nah.  I mean NY or any other big city ingame  15-20 FPS  single core pegged 100%. Just sad.
1412,"Quick synopsis from what I've gathered: Google's terms for the Play store are that they get 30% of in-app purchases. Epic Games didn't like that  so they added a way to make in-app purchases that circumvents that logic. Google didn't like that since it violates their terms  so they removed Fortnite from the play store.  Google has said ""we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play"" while Epic has been making claims that Google is violating its ""Don't be evil"" motto by taking such a high cut and making it hard for apps not on the Play Store to get downloaded.  Sources: https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-android-google-kicked-out/  https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-has-been-removed-from-the-google-play-store/  Personally  it's hard for me to feel bad for either side since they're effectively fighting over a 30% cut in microtransactions"
1413,Planning to make an rpg and was trying to figure if i should make it more like a tactical rpg like Fire emblem or should I go the turn based route lime final fantasy 7. So I just want to ask what would be the challenges and the benefits of either options.
1414,Don't be discouraged! Data science professionals came from very different backgrounds. Since you enjoy working on projects  start building your portfolio online! (I've written a guide [here](https://www.hyperplanes.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-guide/).) Share your portfolio with recruiters  on your resume  in online communities. I'm sure opportunities will come your way.
1415,Truck - Hummer H1 w/ the wagon body style. The coolest truck on the planet. Preferably like ChrisFix’s one  Truck 2 - 7th Gen Chevy Suburban  cuz it’s the most American vehicle on the planet. The biggest diesel motor in the 3/4 ton in also 4x4 configuration because ‘Murica. Can probably fit in a same gen Blazer too for something a bit smaller.  Truck 3 - Some sort of conversion van  like a Chevy G20 or Ford Econoline. See hoovie’s recent video on a G20.  Car 1 - Dodge Challenger Hellcat. All I need to say.  Car 2 - Volkswagen Type 1. Bone stock if possible  don’t really care about year but I figure I’d go for the 70s ones since they’re the cheapest.  Car 3 - Volkswagen Type 2. Probably the split window mega 23 window variant with a bigass chrome roof rack.  Car 4 - 1964-66 Imperial Crown. The most durable and one of the most intimidating cars on the planet.  That’s all I got so far lol
1416,Well  maybe you can play with us? I am part of an open gaming group that plays mostly low-rules RPGs. We play a different one each week based on people's interest  but they are all no-prep and very focused on the roleplaying aspect of the hobby.  We play every Thursday evening. We used to meet in person  but we have moved online due to coronavirus.  To give you an idea of the games we play  the last four we played are:  * [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) * [The Final Voyage of the Selene](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/143554/The-Final-Voyage-of-The-Selene-Bumper-Pack) * [Lasers & Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/) * [Follow](http://www.lamemage.com/follow/)  For more info  you can check the FAQ on our website: [Story Games Club](https://storygames.club/sgw-faq/)  or our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/westchester-geeks/) page to see our upcoming meetup events.  or just DM me.
1417,spend less time gatekeeping and more time driving.  don't worry about the scene. the scene just gets into 3 major accidents when you go for that drive through the canyon  because those cars were setup to park  not drive. build the car you want  do what you want with it. Once you get to the racetrack you'll make new car friends (with very little x-over with the hardparkers) anyway.
1418,I'm also interested in this. I have programming experience and a million ideas  but I'm wondering if its best to just try to build a game by myself over time for the experience and exposure or try to get a team together and go hard. I'd love to know what it takes to make it as an indie game company.
1419,The 3.6 in the GC is direct injection and those often make a hell of a racket.  It may not be an issue  or may not be a big issue.    Take it to the dealer and get a diagnosis.  Put a 10mm socket in the cup holder as a gift for the tech.  They love 10mms.
1420,I just watched SSY and was absolutely blown away (one of my favorites already  must recommend). One of the elements that struck me a lot was actually the animation  which felt really clean  artsy and conveyed the atmosphere of the show really well. For instance  I love Saki's character design  from the face to the clothes. I was thus surprised to find that many people disliked its animation and criticize it for being poor in quality. Why is this? What other anime have animation like SSY? Just curious :P
1421,"If you are in charge of hiring for a DS position particularly for new grads  what do you look for (or strain your eyes in search of) on a resume?  Specific technical skills? A long list of relevant experience? College credentials?   Do you care at all for a fun fact or ""the last book I read was...""? Or are you looking for a strictly professional resume that gives off the aura of diligence  curiosity  and intellect?"
1422,These are very similar  but I'm leaning towards the intel system. GPU is a little faster  but mostly I'm looking at the RAM. Ryzen benefits from faster RAM (3200MHz or greater)  and considering they're the same speed the Intel system won't suffer from the slower RAM.
1423,Have you tried starting with an unstructured dataset? I basically mean pick something you want to know  then go on the hunt for something to scrape that could answer your question. You might need to think a little creatively to gather and prepare your data  and then again to model your crappy noisy dataset.  My experience in small companies in older industries is that they have data which was never intended to be analysed in batch  but they're going to ask you to do it anyway. Data prep is most of the job.  You may also want to look for problems which has well established physics based models and see if you can combine those with the machine learning stuff you know. Though I imagine this is pretty tricky to do solo.
1424,This doesn't even get to the differences  besides cost. MLCC capacitors change capacitance with temperature  which makes them difficult to integrate in designs. They are also sensitive to cracking when soldering them at the factory and can crack if the PCB flexes. Polymer capacitors experience less if a change in capacitance with temperature change  last longer  don't crack  and are cheaper to produce  but don't have a good ESL/ESR like MLCC.  [Article on ESL/ESL](https://circuitdigest.com/tutorial/understanding-esr-and-esl-in-capacitors)  Here's a better write up which is easy to understand if you understand what voltage  resistance  capacitance  and attenuation is.

1426,Hey  I recently learned to drive manual  and I was just wondering if I should rev-match in city traffic. For example  I'm going 15-ish in second gear  and I want to come to a stop. Should I rev-match down to first  then stop  or should I clutch in  and coast/brake to a stop without switching to 1st first.
1427,Shoutout to Sony for including a USB Type C cable that has only USB 2.0 wiring with some of their flagship phones. Caused a great bit of confusion when a customer of mine tried to use it with an external SSD  only to have all sorts of funky errors and data loss happen  because apparently the manufacturer of said SSD never expected such a cable to exist  let alone be used with their storage device.
1428,Call of Cthulhu  playing Edge of Darkness and The Haunting.  Alien  playing Hope's Last Day.  Delta Green  using the free quickstart adventure.  A Song of Ice and Fire RPG (no scenario recommendations).  Eclipse Phase (no scenario recommendations).  Pendragon  the introductory scenario in the rulebook is an excellent one shot which can also launch you into the Great Pendragon campaign if you wish to continue.  The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen (no published scenarios).  A game using the Genesys system. Force and Destiny is a good choice  although I find the published scenarios for it quite weak.  Cold City (has no published scenarios).
1429,"My lack of planning really  I have a set ""they fight this guy here"" or ""they will be in this town trying to do blank here"" but in between that its all improv on my part which when it hits I found really hits... When it misses it REALLY misses but overall my players say they're having fun and that's all that matters at the end of the day."
1430,The answer may not be so straightforward as it’s dependent on how you engineer you features. In most cases  splitting the data before feature engineering will work just fine  but if you want to employ slightly complex techniques such as label encoding and target encoding  things get a bit more complicated. In said case scenario  label encoding requires being executed before splitting or you might miss some values  while Target Encoding must be done after splitting or you will face data leaking issue
1431,"I think it's perfectly fine: it's not a problem unless you think it's a problem.  The psychiatrist Saitō Tamaki writes that otaku have an ""orientation to fiction "" and in fact  defines otaku through this sexuality:    > *  [Otaku] have an affinity for fictional contexts (kyok ̄o no kontekusuto).  > * They resort to fictionalization in order to possess the object of their love.  > * They have multiple orientations when it comes to enjoying fiction.  > * For them fiction itself can be a sexual object.  [(Source--page 227.)](https://mogami.neocities.org/files/robot_ghosts.pdf)  Saitō does not pathologize this attraction  however  but defends it as a legitimate sexual orientation. The anthropologist Patrick Galbraith  too  [defends](https://www.academia.edu/40526032/Otaku_and_the_Struggle_for_Imagination_in_Japan_Introduction_) otaku sexuality/moe as a legitimate identity that reveals new ways of living and being in the world.  Otaku writer/activist Honda Tōru believes relationships with fictional characters to constitute a ""love revolution"" and to be the future of humanity. He encourages people to ""take it easy"" and not get worked up at societal expectations for normative sexuality.  [There's even an entry for otaku sexuality in the *Global Encyclopedia of LGBTQ History*!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/153kBbbV5NdmlvSu1SeyKW46zmFxqMenL/view?usp=sharing)  If you want to make sense of your attraction  I highly recommend the book [*The Moe Manifesto*](https://www.tuttlepublishing.com/japan/moe-manifesto)  which is a great read on both moe/otaku sexuality and the history of otaku. It's written in a very accessible style.  Saito Tamaki's book [*Beautiful Fighting Girl*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/beautiful-fighting-girl) is also really good and relevant  but it can be pretty advanced. The new book [*Otaku and the Struggle for Imagination in Japan*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/otaku-and-the-struggle-for-imagination-in-japan?utm_source=intro&utm_medium=title+page&utm_campaign=pdf-intros-dec19) is about  among other things  the fight of otaku to defend these kind of relationships/attractions. In it  there's an otaku manifesto from 2007 that I find inspiring:  > Calling all Akihabara otaku! Adult computer gamers and anime fans  trainspotters and military maniacs  net news junkies and those interested in communal production  Japanese and foreigners and aliens unite! The time has come to live as we like or live restrained! [...] Everyone  let's take on ""weird forms"" and liberate this darkened city! Unpopular men and women  virgins one and all! Love capitalism is shit! [...] People of heretical sexual orientation! There is nothing wrong with loving the two-dimensional! [...] We will live honestly with our feelings!  ---------- Speaking personally  I have a 2D complex but not a total one: I'm sexually attracted to anime characters but have yet to find one that I'm really romantically attracted to. (I'm also attracted to the three dimensional"

1433,Ae86. Because I'm Irish and well I'd imagine there''s more in Ireland than in Japan now they're kinda of culturally significant now. I'd love it personally because I was very ill and I'd said to my self that when I got better I'd get a twin cam no matter the cost. I'm better and still working towards it. But ya someday.
1434,Another vote for wsl2. I am a recent convert and it's great for most of the things.  You can absolutely find a good laptop with win10 pro below your price range. I would think you can use Google Colab if you need GPU so the money should go for better processor and more ram.
1435,"I have concerns over DLSS. But we do need it or a more open variant of it in the PC gaming space. We saw creative upscaling methods employed for the PS4 and Xbox One. There's no reason MS can't add that as a software-based option for DirectX that could either be utilized by developers  or possibly a user-toggled option for all games (IE  4K selected in-game  but upscaled from 1440p via checkerboard).  My issues with DLSS right now are:  * Proprietary to Nvidia * It seems that it's not a standard feature and requires upkeep (2 examples provided below)  1. Shadow of the Tomb Raider currently has a glitch where many users have to disable DLSS in order to play the game without crashes. As the developer is moving away from this 2018 release  will DLSS begin to work less and less for more and more users? If yes  was DLSS just a timed-exclusive feature for this game through this level of attrition? 2. Death Stranding required a patch to ""enable DLSS for Ampere cards."" Was this truly a necessary patch? Would existing implementation of DLSS work on Ampere and future cards? Or do we really need DLSS patched in for each architecture? If so  this causes a problem for future cards as most developers aren't going to maintain a game forever.  Bottom line is that we need useful upscaling features to improve performance at higher resolutions. But I don't think DLSS is it. I hope it's the gateway to something better."
1436,I'm not really an Asus fan (I really do not like my asus mobo)  but it looks like their design team have really stepped up this time.  I suspect recent maulings from several review sites about some of their other implementations in recent times have given them a kick up the back side.  The ram an vrm extra heatsinks look really good - and just overall  this is so much better than their previous efforts.  Also considering how much reviewers were praising the FE version  the fact that this stomps it in temps is excellent.  And the other thing is the price on this  I've just checked several UK sites  and it is coming in just over £700 which is about the MSRP over here - so they have also hit the value point bang on - its one of the cheapest options available (well...not actually available....but you know what I mean) so they have also hit the value (relatively) point nicely.  Lastly  it isn't very pretty  but it looks a hell of a lot less ugly than some of the 3080 cards (Gigabytes is awful)
1437,Holy shit is that commitment.  When I first saw the link I figured it was another illegally imported car with some bullshit justification about why it was actually here legally  etc.  But nope  he actually did it the one legal way I am aware of short of federalizing one.  My hat is off to you sir  well done.
1438,I reward players for RPing their characters but I don't go out of my way to punish those who do not. Some RPGs handle this great like Blades in the Dark. D&D not so much. When I run D&D it's usually milestone xp  so I gloss over poor stats not being RPd well but when it comes time for those saving throws  watch out!
1439,I'd like to suggest B.E.S.M. 3e  I've been running games with if for about 4years now  and I find it's an incredibly versatile system.  theoretically very simple  2d6+mod  for any action  but the system is so broad you can make literally any kind of character you could imagine.     * Without levels is a must  it's points buy so  no levels!  &#x200B   * Classes/roles are OK  not really any classes/roles  but party balance will help just like any other game.  &#x200B   * Somewhat  generic or easily modified as the campaign is meant to be a sandbox  kitchen sink metaverse/megaverse type campaign spanning multiple genres  its completely generic  you can run dungeon crawls  to space operas  or even slice of life drama.  &#x200B   * Light to moderate crunch is preferred for “hackability” and quick NPC generation on the fly  Character generation can take forever  if you want it to  I strongly suggest starting your PC at base human  and having them steadily acquire powers  adding one or two a session  as you learn the system together.   As for NPC's why fully stat them at all? it's 2d6+mod  just decide on a modifier based on who they are suppose to be  and how good they should be at the task. stat Bosses and important NPC's like combat allies properly  but random background shlubs  why bother?     * Narrative orientated preferred  the system has none combat rules! it's not a war game  like DnD. you as the GM decide what to allocate xp for  not just killing monsters.  &#x200B   * Armor/Defense is based more on resistance mechanics than attack miss mechanics  characters get both a defensive roll  and damage reducing armor.  &#x200B   * “Life  Points” should be more abstract than the traditional hit point systems  natively (preferred) or at hackable (rules options or homebrew) to work  in that way  characters do have HP  but they're are other mechanics that play into this as well. such as Serious injuries(if a character takes more that 1/5 their max hp in a single hit  they save vs stun AND begin to loose 1hp/round(or more)  and with the average adult only having 40hp  they'll be unconscious and bleeding out relatively quickly.) and wound penalties(-1 to everything at half health  and -3 at 1/5max hp)     * Target number (over or under) or success based systems preferred over percentile systems  yep  everything is either over a target number or a contested roll. TN's usually range from 9-24.
1440,another non-lawyer chiming in. As far as I'm aware  a game mechanic or level design is not covered under copyright. Any art/music that you have created is covered though. That's why so many clones are able to exist  they copy the game mechanics/design exactly but replace the art.  If they didn't copy your assets  then you don't have any legal ground to stand on. You could try contacting the creator and ask him nicely to take it down  but don't make any threats. Again  I am not a lawyer  I've just read a bit about this.
1441,We watch a lot of TV together and ran out of things to watch so i got her to watch Erased with me and we both enjoyed it. Now that we've finished it it would be great if we had something similar to watch.   The main positives of Erased were that it had a clear plot  was not too long and it didn't have any weird Japanese shit in it. She isn't crazy about action or fighting so preferably it would not have too much of that but it's not a deal breaker. No scary monsters  zombies or anything of the sort. We tried the first episode of Clannad and March comes in like a Lion but I've seen both of them and shes wasn't crazy about it.   I did a quick browse of the Canadian Netflix library and nothing really jumped out at me so I would appreciate any suggestions.  Sorry to narrow down the selection even more but she's never been very excited about any slice of life stuff I've showed her and I'd prefer a series over a movie. What made Erased so easy to get into was that it had a clear direction starting from episode 1. Also it doesn't have to be on Netflix I can find pretty much anything one way or another. Thanks for all the recommendations I really do appreciate it.
1442,I’d cross post this to mechanicadvice.   Timing belts in theory are easy. 25 years of corrosion and rust holding bolts on may not be easy. What happens if you jump timing  do you know how to fix it. What happens if you can’t get the crank pulley off? Lots of things to go wrong. I’d search Toyota forums online (search Corolla forum or Toyota forum) and find the Corolla section for your generation  there is probably a detailed write up w pics you can follow. It’s a big job so I’d give yourself 2-3 days at least to be safe. Even better if you have a second vehicle and aren’t rushed.
1443,1. Put everything in a git repo. Lock sown the master with branch policies and use branches for personal development. Do pull requests into master even if you are the only person who needs to approve them. 2. Use the pre-commit git hooks to lint  test and auto format your code on every commit. Additionally have it run Mypy for type checking if you are using python with type hints. 3. Use GitHub actions to build a/multiple docker images and run tests inside them. Maybe push the images to a docker repo. Maybe publish your python package to pypi. 4. Once you know how you want to deploy these things AWS  GCP  etc. you can probably follow a tutorial for deploying it. After getting it working manually write a script to do it that runs every time you do a pull request into master.   Each of these may take some googling and trial and error to get used to but I guarantee the code that comes out of this process will be light years ahead of what you would otherwise write.   I’m sure I missed some things and I pretty much assume this is python since that’s what I’m comfortable with. I’d love if anyone could add some good additions to this flow.
1444,Sounds a lot like another developer I know  a real kill zone. Get drunk with the right people  speak the right language  and you are golden. The rest is just meat for the slaughter it seems.  Many companies are like this  not just game dev. It is this type of predatory behavior which gives you better chances at making it I feel. Or so people think.  I had one great boss in my lifetime  it was quite glorious.  And not surprisingly  that place ended up spawning so many amazing developers who are now in top tier positions all over the world.  The power of a little respect  honor  transparency  and the gift of growth cannot be understated imo.
1445,It’s crazy to see how the 3080 is actually getting partially bottlenecked by high end cpu’s at 1440p. I say partially since another factor is how the SM’s are better utilised at 4K hence the biggest performance difference at 4K
1446,let's make some assumptions  do some maths  and then decide  favoring one cour as a large portion of your entries  lets say your average is somewhere close to 15 eps/entry  then lets say you skip OPs and EDs (you monster) making ~20 min/ep or 3 eps/hour or 5 hours/entry.  5 x 150 = 750 hours  31.25 days.  that's just about 1/12 of an overall year... is ~2 hours a day on a hobby too much?  nah  I mean  [this almost two-year old article](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-viewing-compared-to-average-tv-viewing-nielsen-chart-2019-3) says the average Netflix subscriber watches ~2 hours a day... and this was from the before times  I imagine those numbers have skyrocketed during the pandemic.
1447,I still can't believe how he synced the ferris wheel rotation to the anime counterpart.  Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U3XJFm_tuc  If you enjoyed this content  my friend (u/KindaNeet) started his youtube channel (link above). The quality of videos he makes is truly amazing!   Edit: Forgot to mention some additional details about these places. All the places (aquarium included) are in Kasai Rinkai Park  in Chiba. As Oregairu is set in Chiba  most of the real life locations are in Chiba  perhaps to reflect Hachiman's love for Chiba.  In the past  the penguin sign used to match with the one in the anime  but they unfortunately changed it around 2016.  There is no entry fee for the park  while there is a 700 yen (7USD) entry fee for the aquarium   which is a lot cheaper than what you'd pay for most aquariums in Japan (cough Enoshima Aquarium cough). Definately worth checking the place out if you ever go to Tokyo!
1448,5900x and radeon 6000 series in 4k had   61FPS in Bordelands 3 (DX 12) Badass Qaulity  88FPS in COD:MW (DX 12) Ultra Quality  73FPS in GOW5 (DX 12) Ultra Quality  How does that compare with a 10900k + RTX3080?   65FPS in Bordelands 3 (DX 12) Badass Qaulity ([source](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review?page=2))  85FPS in COD:MW (DX 12) Ultra Quality ([source](https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review))  80FPS in GOW5 (DX 12) Ultra Quality ([source](https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review))   Depending how they price and availability against the 3000 series  big navi is looking competitive
1449,I have nothing to add  except that I feel you 100% on this one.  Every week  I get a huge pit in my stomach the night before I run the game  absolutely unprecedented amounts of imposter syndrome.  Crazy that D&D can do this to me  but experimenting on literal multimillion dollar deliverables at my job has basically no effect on me. There's gotta be some innate human fear about social improvisation that drives this phenomenon.
1450,I am looking to make a killer pc  and I want to use the antec striker case but that case is rated as an ITX case. I've seen lots of build videos and It seems to me that that case is more than large enough for an micro atx motherboard  specifically the gigabyte B550 AORUS PRO  and I just had a few questions. Do you think with some mounting modification this would be possible? Do you think this is a good idea? How would you go about creating a mounting conversion from itx points to atx points? Thanks everyone!
1451,What would you recommend to a person with a PhD  who doesn't see a future in academia and is seeking a switch?  I would feel overqualified for a junior position  but  as you say (and I agree)  I haven't yet developed the right skills for a senior / leadership position. The way you phrase it makes seem impossible to frame myself for a career switch.
1452,To respond to this question. I would say Yeah. There's gotta be a sleeper version built of some cars out there. However  I really don't see the point of it. Say  it's cool to see a clean looking Taurus running 500 horses. But do I really want to see a Hyundai Elantra sleeper? Like it'd be cool but it lacks character.
1453,Business analyst   Data analyst – builds data models  reports  and dashboards using SQL and BI tools. They might know a scripting language as well.  Data engineer – builds data pipelines (ETL/ELT) and data infrastructure to support analytics as well as production usage of data. They're first and foremost software developers and might sometimes know very little about statistics or analytics per se.  Machine learning engineer –  builds production-quality implementations of machine learning/AI models. They have a strong understanding of statistics  machine learning algorithms  and software development.  Data scientist – does some combination of all of the above. They make more money than data analysts because they not only know what data analysts know but also make exploratory usage of machine learning/AI models and have just enough software development chops to get into trouble.
1454,Performance looks good generally. Too bad they didn't made a 6 core variant to fight with the 8 core Renoir  because in gaming it actually looks very good.  Another big unknown is battery life  but I expect it to be similar to Ice Lake  which was fine.
1455,As a player don’t waste your time playing in a game with a DM that doesn’t give two squats about the PCs or the time the players have invested. And vice versa  when you have players that don’t contribute anything to the story.
1456,My ds interviews were always like half spent on case study business kinds of questions (like a hypothetical project  what would I do and why  let’s say I got this data how would I interpret it  etc). Are you getting interviews like this? If so  maybe it’s not that you do t have lots of line items on your resume but rather you’re not doing a great job on these case studies. If that is the situation  that’s great— you probably could practice these with your network.
1457,I’m looking to GM a new system as the ones I’m familiar with aren’t hitting all the right notes for the campaign I am planning. The campaign is going to start with the PCs in a room and discovering their situation  and the world  through play.   Here is what I feel hits the high points in the mechanics of the system I am looking for (in no particular order). If you are able to provide a quick synopsis of the system  it would be appreciated  &#x200B   * Without levels is a must * Classes/roles are OK * Somewhat generic or easily modified as the campaign is meant to be a sandbox kitchen sink metaverse/megaverse type campaign spanning multiple genres * Light to moderate crunch is preferred for “hackability” and quick NPC generation on the fly * Narrative orientated preferred * Armor/Defense is based more on resistance mechanics than attack miss mechanics * “Life Points” should be more abstract than the traditional hit point systems natively (preferred) or at hackable (rules options or homebrew) to work in that way    * Looking for a system similar to stress tracks in FATE  damage boxes in Shadowrun 1e to 3e  or the damage tracking in the Storyteller/Storypath systems * Target number (over or under) or success based systems preferred over percentile systems

1459,Do not do this  work experience as a data scientist at a tech company will be sufficient enough. GitHub code examples are pretty irrelevant unless you have some impressive personal project. Code samples may help if you have no previous experience.
1460,Now I had a bit of a strange Career Path but I am currently a Technical Artis in Mobile Games.  I started at an 3D Animation out as Fx Artist  then became FX TD (Python)  then that studio decided to do a Animation Show in Unreal Engine. Level Blueprint Logic  setup Ai Characters and make the Ai logic for Background Characters and I fixed Fx Blueprints.  I then became an Fx Artist on Gears of War 5 but that wasn’t technical again. Then went back to the Animation Studio as Tech Artist but there were a bunch of false promises so when I got an offer with all the things I wanted I jumped ship to mobile games.  Unity is weird but the job is good.  Tldr: Animation/Film if you can support Maya/Motionbuilder with Python
1461,"The fact that Nvidia does not disclose number of units available in their online store or number of GPUs to be pushed by partners is a tell-tell sign. It is a numbers game. Scalpers are not stupid. They would not try to commit so much cash  risking losing money if supply is solid.  I am speculating here  so please ignore at will. I think people ""in the know"" had pretty good idea about very limited supply  and scalpers got the wind of it. The supply seemed so low that potential reward hugely outweighed the risk of not being able to resell botted GPUs until supply increases. Scalpers knew that supply is not going to meet demand for months."
1462,Your experience sound like mine. It's been 10+years and not one helped  Pretty much everyone was selfish and fake. It took me 10 years to learn what I could have learned in1-2 years. People true at heart are looked down in this industry but there are some good people. Stick to them. Trust your instincts.   I really liked the essence of analytics so I stayed and hustled on. I still make very silly mistakes. Dont worry abt new mistakes  this is a field that requires a lot. If you are not repeating them  you would be fine. I have seen people at big consulting firms making big bucks because they were politically correct.    Find a group where you can practice your skills. Find people who like to talk to you. This will give a place to unwind and rebuild yourself. All the best.
1463,"The rule itself wasn't awful  but the timing was.  We were playing 4E. My girlfriend was playing the healer and had gotten dropped  so the only chance we had to fix her was to feed her a potion. We spent 3 rounds working together to get me to her  since I both had a potion and the least chance of getting hit trying to reach her. One more hit will drop me  too  but that's not a problem. She can fix me once she's back on her feet. I pull out the potion  prepare to pour it down her bard's throat...  ""You know what? Using a potion like that should provoke an opportunity attack. What's your AC?""  This started a 20 minute argument. We had checked the rulebook before we started and hadn't found anything that said giving someone a potion provoked an OA. The GM had sat there and listened to us work toward this for 3 rounds. He couldn't find the rule either. He even admitted that as far as he was concerned  it was a house rule. The entire party dug our heels in and refused. If he wanted to make it a rule going forward  that was fine. But springing it on us at that exact moment was incredibly scummy.  He backed down. That wasn't the first or last time he tried to screw us with mechanics  but I think it was the most flagrant."
1464,I bought a 2006 Sonic Ion over the weekend. It’s in surprisingly good shape w/ just over 106k miles. There’s a quirk with the locking mechanisms though. For one the buttons to lock and unlock from the inside make a sound as if they’re working but don’t. Also anytime I turn it off all 4 doors unlock and I have lock them by hand. Any ideas what this may be?  Also the check engine light comes on and off. When it’s on the only code it shows is P0498
1465,I have always called it dee-twenty since it is tee-twenty in my language (T20  *tetjugo*). And when I much later started listening to RPG related videos on Youtube it turns out dee-twenty was the by far most common way to say it.
1466,"I like it  but top-trim levels in glamorous product shots aren't really representative of the base model you'll see on the street. While I think the Ridgeline makes a lot of sense in that most people don't really need the capabilities of their trucks (self included)  I'm not sure what the upside is as you're paying just as much and you'll likely be worse off in 5 years from resale given the Ridgeline's polarizing rep.  Where you'd think it would benefit it doesn't as much as you'd expect: Maneuverability-wise  its dimensions are sort of midsize truck length with full-size truck width (210"" long and 79"" wide) and full-size turning circle (44.4ft vs a Tundra at 44.0ft)  so no real gains there. Fuel-economy  it comes in behind the 2.7 F150 and similar to the midsizers  no real gains there either. Even reliability-wise  would you really trust a Honda V6+9AT combo more than say  the Tacoma or Silverado drivetrains? If it were more CR-V sized and had a $28K LX model  that would be a different story and a real differentiator in terms of cost and size/maneuverability but it's a challenging sell as-is."
1467,Hi  I’ve been trying to choose an engine and am a bit overwhelmed with the amount of options  even after reading a bunch of articles and the FAQ here.  I’ve used Xcode and Sprite Kit / Swift to make an iOS game in the past  but this time I want to make a game that can be played in desktop browsers  mobile browsers  and app store / google play store.  The game will be a tower defense style game  have 2D cartoony graphics  and have real time multiplayer.  I’m a front-end engineer in my career and would prefer to avoid doing as little networking as possible. Colyseus looks pretty interesting for that reason  but are there any frameworks with multiplayer networking built in? I know nothing will do everything for me  just would prefer more help with the networking aspect.  I’d also prefer a Javascript engine  but I’m open to learning a new language if it’s really worth it. I’ll also be the sole developer  so more built in features are better.  Some options that seem promising: - Phaser and GDevelop look good  but I don’t think Colyseus works with them - Cocos Creator - Godot and Defold looked interesting but don’t support Javascript  Are there any other options I should consider? Anything that sounds like it checks most of my boxes?  Thank you!

1469,Hey  I’m just finishing my CS degree and have chosen a ds heavy final year project and have 2 years experience in Devops (done a lot of python sql and automation) but want to move over to a ds role  do you think I will have to do a masters/PhD or will be hireable without it?
1470,I’ll second the congrats! It’s really hard to study these things on top of another job  so major props. It’s nice to hear it working out for someone  I was also thinking about applying for the IBM one (even though I still have so much to learn). Good luck on the interview!!
1471,Juggling multiple storylines occurring concurrently.  I typically run very small groups. Once you have three storylines that are going in different directions at the same time  my pacing goes to shit  and my improv takes a nose-dive.
1472,The theme of my picks is that the plots revolve around working age adults and their daily lives   * I Don't Understand What My Husband is Saying * Wotakoi * Netjuu no Susume * Servant x Service * New Game! * Shirobako
1473,Lack of commitment and lack of a spine. I tend to do as much work as I can on a campaign before it even starts because I know I'm going to rapidly lose my desire to think about it as it goes on.  And I tend to let my players get away with a lot of shit. If they want a fully automatic machine gun then I'm like  whatever man as long as everyone is having fun.
1474,If you interact with your keyboard a lot  e.g. writing code  working the command line interface  traditional keyboard layout is problematic for your wrist and your shoulder. However  going extreme ergonomic keyboard could be really difficult for many people. A fine balance between convenient and ergonomic is the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard  successor to the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000  that is easy to use and actually ergonomic that reduces stresses on your wrist and shoulder. I no longer use my mech keyboard but just  Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard  &#x200B   The problems with normal keyboard is described here and I'm already experienced them all: [https://kinesis-ergo.com/pain/](https://kinesis-ergo.com/pain/)
1475,Ive always loved bench seating. Never understood why its gone for good. Seating 6 is way cooler than having more storage but seating less people.

My players won't be very experienced roleplayers  and I'm not a very experienced GM! I'd really love to steal ideas (and honey) and hear tips.
1478,Another low effort cash grab by Nintendo.   Link's Awakening bothered me because it was a 30 year old gameboy game that they didn't even bother to make sure had a consistent framerate and still charged 60 bucks for it.  This bothers me because if they were going to go cheap and use an emulator and still charge 60 bucks why couldn't they have at least included Mario Galaxy 2?   The original Mario All-Stars had 4 games on it. Now will we ever even get a re-release of Galaxy 2? Will it cost 60 bucks on it's own? There's absolutely no reason it shouldn't be there if all they had to do was emulate it.  Fuck this collection.
1479,I'll throw my 2 cents in with Savage Worlds. That can be as serious as you want. Limit the combat edges and combat becomes a LOT more dangerous. There's a SW ETU let's play by Wildcards on Saving Throw Show  that really brings out the horror of the unknown. Those players get into their characters being just college students and not Buffy/Supernatural monster slayers.

1481,YES. I have macbook 2011 and even though its become obsolete  it still barely runs unity and gets some things done. Now i have built a decent pc since last year  so dont use it that much.   I can only imagine what cool stuff you ca do in UNITY with 2017 macbook air  you won't get any issues..until unless you implement high tris AAA models...coding and normal indie level tris should make you run smooth.

1483,As expected. AMD finally beat Skylake by as much as 5% after all these years.   This launch is bitter sweet. High prices like that leave a lot to be desired and the modest 5% over 10900k means Rocket Lake in March will have a good 10-15% over Zen 3.  Adding to that the fact that Zen 3 isn't future proof as it is the last AMD CPU on AM4  I'm not sure what to do as someone who wanted to buy a new PC this year.

1485,The instructions for the GM in Apocalypse World. I don’t say “GM advice”  because the author lays it out in such a way that what you say and do when  as GM  is really part of the system. It’s not restrictivre  it’s not like “you can only do X”  but it does add structure in a really good way.  It’s something the other pbta games could have used more of in my opinion  and the ones that follow that structure do well.
1486,Probably would be able to run them  but I think they'll lower the settings as well. CPU bottlenecks are the hardest thing to mitigate as it affects game logic - the Series S doesn't really compromise on the CPU.   Reducing visual effects or resolution to account for lower GPU power is the easier compromise. That's why MS went with it. I personally don't expect more than 1080p for true next-gen titles from a 20 CU part.
1487,I’m not a fan of the menagerie of PC races in the newest editions but there has been some gonzo stuff in D&D for almost as long as it’s been around. Expedition to Barrier Peaks had the PCs exploring a crashed spaceship.
1488,"It's basically in the ""we don't really know but it's going to be a really long time until it's here"" stage.   Best case scenario I can image is that maybe the TV after my next TV will be a MicroLED  and I just bought my current TV  and I don't upgrade them more than once every 5-7 years or so.  For monitors  I just hope OLED gets stable enough to become viable in the mainstream within the next 5 years or so. Unlikely we are going to see reasonable Microled monitors this decade. Maybe a couple of models from Apple (who are investing heavily in this tech) and the rare non-Apple OEM here or there for some astronomical price in a couple of years.. and a long nothing in terms of products that could be viaibly purchased as daily drivers. Definitely not something to put on our radars for years to come  but it's nice that they are somewhere out there behind the horizon."
1489,3080 looks like Fermi power with Kepler VRAM.  Hopefully they'll release a 3080 with with lower power consumption and 20GB VRAM. Right now the 3080 Reference card (FE) doesn't look attractive as a 4K gamer in the long run.
1490,I will take a look at Mythras historical settings for inspiration. I've read some Mythic Britain and it's very good. It even include rules for big battles which I will be adapting in other campaign when needed. There's also Mythic Rome and some more.  If you like the system  the combat has a lot of options without magic so it should be interesting enough.
1491,Hello again!  I’m looking for a suggestion on a system that can handle well a low-fantasy setting based on European colonization of South America  with added low-magic (probably shamanism  divination) and inquisition. So politics  social interaction  exploration of wilderness  upheavals  archaic firearms. Only humans.   I’ve tried GURPS (didn’t try gurps fantasy but looked ok to me)  but it just takes too much preparing. No D&D  obviously.   Any thoughts?
1492,Oh and In-case you americans are wondering  the manual version is actually quite a bit cheaper than the automatic since people use manuals here. I've seen the prices of the M/T trim on the US  and oh God those prices are terrible...
1493,Very interested and just filled out the survey. Been working in a data analyst type role for 6+ years  without the data analyst job title. I'm also half way done with my Data Science Professional Certification. Would love any insight on helping get my foot in the door as an actual data scientist/analyst.
1494,God  I really hope so badly that Jun Maeda finally learned how to write a freaking 1-cour anime screenplay after how much Angel Beats and Charlotte burned us. The slice of life and comedy are really on point so far and have that super delightfully familiar 'Key' charm  but then again those other two shows also had great comedy and seemed totally fine before they completely fell apart midway through...   I have absolutely zero expectations for this one  but this is the number one show this season I'm praying the absolute hardest doesn't fuck up. At the very least if nothing else we'll get some gorgeous PA Works animation and backgrounds  around 6 episodes of great SoL comedy  and Sakura Ayane CVing a wise loli-type character~
1495,"I find it funny that people are referring to USB-C's introduction in the past tense  when for a lot of people  it's still the ""newfangled thing that you don't see often"". I know a ton of non-tech-savvy people that still use micro-b for everything. Heck  I don't even own a usb-c device anymore  my headphones  my controllers  they all use micro-b  except for my phone."
1496,I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look at the methodology in depth just yet. Apologies if you already deal with my below questions in the article.   Do you have a baseline for your VTT false positive/false negative rate (How often does it detect a word when there is no word/misses a word/provides incorrect word)? Do you have standardization of inputs in terms of sound quality? As I do not see a train/test split outlined  how does the classification system perform on out of sample data? Are “mumble” tracks pre-labeled?
1497,I suggest Cypher or Fate.  Cypher  while it doesn't have rules for money or amount of time  allows players to use XP to get benefits like you want. There are specific XP amounts for certain things (3 XP for a house  etc.) but there is no time amount attached.  Fate allows players to do something similar  but without XP. Fate coins/points allow the players to introduce their own story elements.  Both games are also highly flexible and moldable  allowing you to play whatever type of game you want  including what genre. Cypher has rules for different genres built in to it  while Fate doesn't (that I know of).
1498,"this is rumor not news  ""Southeast Asia will produce half of the world's notebook personal computers in 2030  a Taiwanese government think tank predicts""     ""Compal Electronics is considering building output capacity in Vietnam  while Quanta Computer  the world's third-largest contract manufacturer  is expected to produce notebook PCs in Thailand.""    It's also worth noting that Vietnam has only had minimal success at stealing chinese low cost manufacturing"
1499,I actually made a one page rpg a while back with campfire play specifically in mind.  It's called Campfire Cavefolk. If you give it a whirl  I'd appreciate the feedback.  Download here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IPEirezMt5M2QkrS4E4g3vFqpPxqq5ZZ/view?usp=drivesdk
1500,In my local area and friend group  We love them  JDM legends are infinitely more popular than euro and yank tanks. Aussie cars such as commodores  Falcons and Territories are often modified in similar fashion to the Japanese trends too.  There is big love for sedans and wagons especially  Legacy Spec B (2.5 turbos and H6 models)  LS400s  Aristos/GS300's  skylines and JZX110s are the most popular right now. MR2's  MX5s and s chassis also being fan favourites.
1501,My understanding is that the limit for a PCIE x16 slot is 75W of power delivery  but is that the same for PCIE 4 as well?  My impression is that PCIE 4 uses more power  and I was just wondering if some of that is for power delivery.

1503,Yeah  same for me. I also like to do it after some initial `EDA`. This is because if you split your dataset in the initial phase then you have to perform your `data cleaning` in the two sets separately so  its better to perform the `data cleaning`  and then split it.
1504,"Here's some sports anime recs I wrote up a while back which I think fit well as a fun watch when you're in the midst of doing a lot of exercise/work outs. They're sorted by sport type  and a lot/most are really encouraging.  **Boxing:** Hajime no Ippo - zero to hero bullied kid learns to box and improves himself as a person  maturing mentally and physically. Nice coming of age tale.  **MMA/Fighting:** History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi. Boy under many martial arts teachers learning Muay Thai  Karate  Judo  etc. Pretty funny and mostly light fun but with cool martial arts fights against gangs and such.  **Board Games:** Hikaru no Go/Chihayafuru. Both feature characters learning a game and improving at it. Feature tournaments and growth of the characters. Nice casts  rivals  teammates  etc.  **Video Games:** King's Avatar. Only e-sports anime I know  but it's a very good one about an ex-pro player who continues playing and eventually gathering a team to compete with. Nice animation for its fights and talks about stuff like DPS/group dungeons in video games.  **Music/Band:** Hibike Euphonium. There's a lot of music based anime  but I think this is the one that encompasses the idea of a ""team"" and working toward a ""championship"" the most while having well done character development  which I think are traits typical to sports anime.  **Soccer:** Whistle! - I only read the manga but it was a good underdog story about a boy getting better and improving with his team. There's an anime  but I haven't checked it in depth. An alternative is Captain Tsubasa  but I wasn't as huge a fan of this and felt Whistle! told a better coming of age story about a boy and his teammates.  **Basketball:** Slam Dunk if you want a more serious  traditional shonen sports tale as he learns/improves. Kuroko no Basket if you want something more unique: superpowers in your basketball games.   **Volleyball:** Haikyuu! - high jumper midget joins team with a rival and the team improves together. Pretty bright  lighthearted  and fun. Realistic enough cast with some nice development time.  **Baseball:** Major for longer series showing pitcher kid from childhood to adulthood as he improves  meets friends and rivals  and overcomes obstacles and hurdles through life. Fairly emotional too. Another good one that's emotional but a slow burn: Cross Game  also about a pitcher and his team but not quite as many episodes and focused on Koushien (championship tournament for school baseball in Japan)  **Swimming/Diving:** Rough! (manga only) boy gets better at swimming as girl improves at diving. Mainly focused on the boy as he improves his swimming times  but it also has a strong romantic plot between the two MCs  who start off as enemies from opposing families. If you only want an anime  you can try Free!  about boys swimming together. Wasn't for me but others may enjoy it.  **Badminton:** Hanebado. Really interesting dual story about two girls  who have a shift in perspective after a match t"
1505,The first adventure of my first time GMing a game will take place at an archaeological dig site.  I was wondering how many people at a dig site? I'll most likely make  it up.  But would be cool to know?
1506,You can run a serious DnD campaign  but you gotta set the tone properly  and get proper player buy-in. And then enforce it in play. All three are required to make it work.   It's not easy  regardless of system (although some systems support this better). I know I can't pull it off. But I know it can be done.
1507,Hello   &#x200B   **Background**:  I'm a recent college grad (majored in math and statistics) who's trying to strengthen my chances for getting into some sort of data science/analytics role or internship.  &#x200B   I'm comfortable with several of the toolsets within data science and now I'm trying to apply that knowledge into projects. In terms of my knowledge:  \- I've coded in python for 4 years  R 1 year  \- Am familiar with and have experience with NumPy  Pandas  Scikit Learn  \- I'm intermediate at MySQL and working towards becoming more advanced  \- Know how to use Tableau  \- And I have a good grasp (I think) of regression and classification supervised ML algorithms. Will be focusing on unsupervised learning projects once I get some supervised projects done.  &#x200B   I want to now work on some projects that go through the entire data science process i.e. gather data  create a database  explore data  produce and tweak models  choose the best one and form some conclusion.  &#x200B   **My Problem**: So after doing research on project suggestions  I've come across many YouTube videos strongly recommended scraping data from the web for projects. I just spent the whole afternoon today creating a web scrapper with Beautifulsoup only to have it suddenly not work on me anymore (I think the website I was scrapping from flagged me as a bot). I've tried starting from scratch on other websites only for my code to either not work again (infinite wait times for my code to download the webpage info). I also came across Scripy which from my readings seems to be more efficient than Beautifulsoup but is a lot more complicated and I'm not sure I'll run into similar problems. There's also preexisting scrapers but they all cost money and the ones I've used so far were pretty annoying to use or had significant limits.  &#x200B   **My Question**: After all that effort and frustration  I'm wondering if I'd be better of just using/combining pre-existing data from websites (like the [data.gov](https://data.gov)) and focusing more of my efforts on creating the database  modeling  creating visualizations and analyzing the results rather then spending a couple weeks to understand data scraping. So what do you guys think?  &#x200B   **Some More Background**:  \- I feel really behind in my job search. I was actually planning on taking this extra semester so I really didn't do much over the summer. Then when the semester started I realized online classes wasn't very conducive for me and I'd be better off graduating and job searching instead. Because of my lack of planning I'm now 4 months behind in my job search due to the unproductive summer.  \- I've gotten a lot of rejections (which is very understandable and I'm sure relatable to a lot of people here) but it's been quite disheartening. Still I'm using it as a learning experience and it's helped me figure out what things I need to work on (thus the skills I've developed so far). I'd just like to increase my chances 
1508,I have the flaw to not sufficiently read the intentions of my players and properly react to their actions through a NPC. Like sometimes I would skip the reaction of my NPC entirely making the battles feel a bit like slogfests of HP.
1509,Just leave out the stuff that you don't like and tailor it to your needs. Everyone regardless of their political views can design a good game. If they include world views that you don't like  leave them out. If they include content that makes you uncomfortable in any way  leave it out.  Accept that people have different opinions and don't let statements like in Lancer trigger you.
1510,I would love to see a leaked developers blog for the recent animal crossing  they need to answer for why it shipped glitchy and stripped of features. Worst AC yet  they didn’t finish it. They’re rolling out “updates” that just add features already in old games.
1511,This is such a good read  sorry my dumb ass misread you and thought it’s talking about data science being a “sexist” field of 21st century and the entire time I was reading it I was waiting for the author to talk about gender inequality  smh
1512,That’s too bad  I’m sure they’ll do good though. A lot of hype for a game like this  I know it’s something I’ve waited 10+ years for now. Glad to see a studio putting in the effort I’d imagine all of us fans would expect.
1513,Find something of small scope and do it to the definite end.  Let me share a story with you. Years ago  a man who had no programming experience decided to step into game development. He picked a simple runner idea  you know the kinda game where you auto walk to the right and jump to avoid pits and collect coins. He was never bothered choosing between cocos2d nor Unity3D but rather just grabbed the most basic Java library and made an Android game out of it. He put the game live on Google Play  learned about setting up store  iterating CTR  listening to feedback  monitoring analytics funnels  so and and so forth. The simple game got a 4.5 rating as it was bug free and easy to play. It got about 100K installs (not much back then)  a couple hundred dollars of revenue over a year  and most of all  happiness. He finally built something from end to end for real players.  The smaller the scope  the more likely you can ship it and stick to the definite end. And when you do for the first time  you're out of the pitfall you described.
1514,More grip off the line  but that only helps if the car has enough output to overpower the tires. Lots of cars these days do  but not all cars ever  you know?  But that off-the-line grip doesn't matter once the tires do find traction  and then the added weight of the AWD system has a negative affect on acceleration the rest of the time.  Also  AWD won't add to top speed since it doesn't change the gearing  and weight doesn't affect the engine's output or aero. It might actually lose some top speed due to the added friction of the moving parts of the AWD bits  though I reckon that's only worth a few MPHs.
1515,"I get the feeling they've just decided to show some things earlier in order to [Umineko ""spoilers""](/s ""give the story a more meta feel similar to Umineko"").   I could be wrong  but my bet is that they actually intend to encourage viewers to solve the mystery this time around. Perhaps even explicitly. The novel may have done something similar with the ""tea party"" scenes  but Deen's adaptation just looked like a straight up psychology thriller rather than a proper mystery.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the beginning of ep 2 feels like a ""tactical spoiler"". It's like letting viewers have that earlier in order to make the solvable mysteries stand out. [Higurashi spoilers](/s ""If there's one thing that wasn't quite solvable in the novel  it was the supernatural stuff. Unless you resorted to super natural explanations  which to me is as good as giving up on solving the mysteries. So by getting the super natural out of the way earlier  they might make the whole story more solvable in a way."") It's hard to say if that's their true goal though  just speculation."
1516,Don't forget that in a less technical company your DS unit can have quite some similarity to a start up! If DS in new to the company  you can end up having actually quite a lot of freedom in how you explore the space of possible solutions  although there might be initial limitations in implementation.  You have a chance to start and shape the DS culture and data-driven thinking and problem solving in the company. You have the chance to face many problems for the first time and learn a lot about DS in solving these problems as a pioneer in the company.  This could be a lot of opportunity for making great impact (low hanging fruits) in an established company  when right culture is in place. As long as you move in small steps and remember to deliver value along the way (solve meaningful problems for the company)  there should be less concern about your use of tools and techniques. Luckily  this can happen now with the security and resources of an established organization  instead of a growing start-up.  I have worked both in a start up and a rather big company setup in DS and loved both experiences. Contrary to some popular belief  as long as you're creating value  there's actually more room for failure in bigger companies. The pressure for success in a startup can itself be crushing (you can be always finding yourself aiming to over deliver  waiting for the big breakthrough). In an established company  you have more cushion for failure and you probably also have more of a chance to spread your bets among some safer (but potentially more boring) and some riskier (but offering more opportunities for learning) solutions. Of course making huge changes in a working system is more difficult than a start up  but that doesn't mean you won't have a chance to learn new things.
1517,It’s always been like that. We tend to remember the cool  unique cars of the past and skip over the everyday stuff.  50 years from now  do you think we’ll see Honda Pilots in the same way we’d see an Audi R8?
1518,I really like what they’re doing with the premise. It’s the complete opposite of MHA  people with superpowers are seen as the villains  whether they’ve actually done something bad or not. You can see where the government is coming from  but their way of thinking is still wrong... Nevertheless  Nana is a great character  kudos to her VA.   I wish more this was more popular on this sub...
1519,My previous set of tires  MPSS  did kind of crack after i visited my parents in the North Bay Area where it gets to upper 20's  lower 30s in winter routinely. It's not like your tires crack in half or anything but if you look closely you will see it looks like the rubber kind of dried out.
1520,That is same thing new Hummer EV apparently won’t scare Ford at all too.   Time will tell us. I feel GM would answer Jeep and Bronco soon with an affordable or small version Hummer EV.   Now  GM only wants to answer F150 Raptor and TRX with Silverado ZR2.
1521,"Lawyer with Master's in Political Science  I worked mainly in human rights/humanitarian operations for international organizations. Grew tired of the whole ""I think..."" approach for solving problems and always enjoyed quant research so moved to DS within the sector. There is still a lack of expertise and donors are increasingly interested in how data can be used for more efficient implementation. Domain expertise can take you a long way in this specific field even without a strong math background (and if you are willing to live in conflict zones)."
1522,Depends on the application   For drag  RWD is best because when you accelerate   momentum pushes all the weight to the rear tires.  That's why Drag cars have super skinny front tires.  There's not enough weight up front for any meaningful traction.   It really just comes down to finding the best solution for traction  and if it's worth the drive train power loss for the solution.   Rally cars do well with AWD because the best tire for traction varies wildy through out the track.
1523,Pretty good difference there. I have a 2070 super and it plays this game incredibly well. The engine is mindblowing  so I'm sure that plays into the performance as well. Overall I wouldn't expect other benchmarks of less optimized games to perform as well as this.
1524,I've read the Data Science From Scratch text book cover to cover  I didn't understand most of it and I did the Python Zero to Hero course on udemy  but I haven't actually coded anything yet.     I'm a college dropout and now I have some time on my hands since my store shuttered during the pandemic. My plan right now is to finish the courses on Kaggle and do as many projects on Kaggle as I can. Whatever I don't know with regards to math or python I figure I'd learn from Udemy courses.      Is it realistic that I get a job/internship from Kaggle projects alone?     Should I go back to college to get a degree? A bootcamp?     Did you guys pick up the math and coding on a need to know basis while doing projects or is that too optimistic?
1525,"Going back and forth between Forbidden Lands and Blades in the Dark. Lots of ""ooh""s and ""aaah""s for both.  Next  I want to figure out Fate  or Fate Accelerated. It seemed pretty simple at first  but a quick look through the rules tell me I'll have to study it a bit more."
1526,Depends what you're trying to do and who you're doing it for.  SAS is corporate  proprietary  complex  expensive  you're at their mercy. Colleges/Universities are just SAS certification mills that lend cachet to the idea SAS certification is special. It's good at what it does  but lots of better alternatives. Where I give SAS kudos is they offer a free virtualbox image of a SAS environment for the autodidacts like me. Considering how many great free alternatives there are its easy to see why they do.  R is open  easy to learn  great with massive amounts of data. But for dynamic analysis it's best for backtesting models  simulations  theories  etc. You wouldn't want R used for some kinds of automated real time production - for example  analyzing real time market data for black box algo trading.  But Python (more specifically scipi & numpy) is easy  open  flexible  dynamic  powerful   great for real time analysis. Scala and Julia are also great and feel familiar to folks who'd prefer Java or R  over Python.  And then if you want get really freaky  dust off your lambda calculus and get down with some Haskell  Erlang  OCaml.... yeah baby!
1527,I see your point...so many hard-to-predict factors like health issues  family issues  issues that the actual company is having  etc probably make it pretty tough to predict individual churn. Maybe not so fruitless for overall trends.
1528,I'm pretty sure I won't be buying this. I've had enough of Nintendo's shit  I can't believe that its just a straight up port and the Disney vault-esque forced scarcity tactic where it just won't be sold after March is messed up.
1529,I’m in GT OMSA and I’d recommend it. Also the degree will open you up to other avenues like DE & SWE if you get creative with your classes. The programs total cost is 12k ~ which means if you decide you hate it a semester in it’s a much cheaper mistake than being somewhere else.
1530,My question would be were balanced encounters expected or implied?  If he felt that every encounter would be blananced because of the design of the campaign or something that you said  or something you didn't say  then it is possible you are at fault.    You should clearly state in session zero that all encounters are not balanced and players need to determine if an encounter is something that is in their range or something they need to avoid.   This is specifically troublesome in D&D where players ALWAYS expect every encounter to be blanced by default.  As the GM you do not need to offer only balanced encounters  I don't  but you must make it clear in advance.    Yes  a player seeing chracters who are way above them dying in a battle and who runs in anyway is a bit of an idiot  but maybe they felt something would change as the battle went forward.
1531,"There are enough people not liking Toradora just because they ""can't stand violent tsundere getting away with everything"" to need me to say something - not so much argue but point out different reading of the story.  Similar with Haruhi  because of endless 8  or Haruhi herself being Haruhi.  Muv Luv adaptations were often criticized too  if not outright ignored. Again I try point out what I like them for.   Ultimately it's a matter of taste  not everyone like the same things."
1532,Bandit algorithms were made specifically for problems such as these. Especially when paired with Bayesian analysis. Bandit algorithms aren't terribly hard to learn  but plan to spend most of your time learning about Bayesian analysis and the different distributions which may apply to your data. I believe there is an O'Reilly book called Bandit Algorithms that should be a good place to start.
1533,> Daimler also aims to release a new software vehicle operating system  known as MB.OS  by 2024 and to **use over-the-air updates to generate an operating profit of 1 billion euros by 2025 from digital services  including parking and charging.**  What  God by the time I'm finally done with my student loans and able to buy a cooler car I'm not even going to want to own anything being built...
1534,It's a combination of a few things  the two biggest being lowered job security so people aren't buying new as much  and lower production which means that those who would have bought new might buy used because there's not much inventory. This drives up used car demand  and thus price.
1535,If it is true  there are two conclusions:  1. Many spare chips that must be cut down  meaning manufacturing immaturity.  2. Full throttle on performance  in order to bury AMD's offerings.  Not mutually exclusive.
1536,"[Songbird by batts.](https://johnbattle.itch.io/songbird)     From the store page: *""What if knights didn't slay dragons and instead helped them with their emotional issues?""*  *That was the thought that spawned Songbirds  and it aims to carry  forward the idea of combating those intangible things that we struggle  with on a daily basis. I know I've wanted to punch my anxiety in the  face on numerous occasions. Well  now we can. Together.""*     It's a very loose game with a small collection of very interesting rules  ranging from a travel mechanic based around stacking dice in real life to building dungeons by building playlists to mechanics about faith and love and a space on the character sheet for the musical genre that represents your character right below the space for your war name. Stress on the same part of the character sheet as inventory and as it stacks up it start to take space away for physical things. The GM tools are evocative and interesting.   The ""what is an RPG"" section at the beginning is a short paragraph that ends ""EVERYONE HAS FUN. GOOD LUCK DON’T DIE""     Plus  the included soundtrack is pretty good."
1537,Most games solve the door problem by ignoring the majority of those questions. It's pretty common to run around any game with a town and have no idea which doors are actually interactable until you run up and try to open it. Your AI companions blocking doorways is also a classic.
1538,Remove the R  remove the chrome  make everything else matte black and we have a perfect card!  &#x200B   edit: I don't know how can Jay be a tech pundit and think of the FE cards  accusing AMD of copying  and ignore the XFX cards of the [1st gen GCN](https://www.tweakpc.de/hardware/tests/grafikkarten/xfx_amd_radeon_hd_7870_7850_black_edition/s15.php). Does this guy even know anything about tech other than being a glorified PC plumber?
1539,My sibling is far more invested into musicians and guitarists than I am  so I wasn't aware of who he was or what he meant to the music world. Looking at his cars  he definitely has interesting tastes in cars too.  RIP.
1540,I haven’t been pulled over since I was a kid. Both times I was pulled over I was going 20+ over. I consistently drive about 20 over on the interstate and haven’t been pulled in over 10 years. I also drive 30k+ miles per year for work so it’s not like it’s a small sample size. I think the trick is just reading the area and being safe when going fast. If I’m in traffic I go with the flow. If there’s nobody around I usually set my cruise to 19 over and just keep scanning for cops.
1541,It's still early days  but I'm liking Nijisaki a lot more than the original and Sunshine. Nijisaki seems less...sillier than the other two at times but it also feels like there's already more depth to it.
1542,Ryzen CPUs perform 30-40% better with dual channel memory. Get another [Hynix HMA81GS6JJR8N-VK](https://www.amazon.com/Hynix-PC4-21300-DDR4-2666MHz-260-Pin-HMA81GS6CJR8N-VK/dp/B07JP4C1PD) DIMM.  **EDIT** UserBenchMark well understates the performance of Ryzen CPUs as they have been paid by Intel to do so.
1543,"So a noble's title was abrogated and he seeks evidence to clear his name?  Seems suspect.  Usually such a conspiracy was done by rivals working WITH the lord that revoked the status.  Additionally  any papers that could clear his name would have been destroyed.  It's also common for nobles to be exiled in lieu of losing one's title.  So here is my addendum:  The noble cannot be in a jurisdiction of the target mansion  rather  in a villa or private residence using his own personal wealth.  Secondly  the noble should fully expect the heist to be a suicide mission or complete failure.  This SHOULD be a possible assassination attempt  or a ""heist"" turned assassination  leading to a bigger plot hole.  Example: he sends the players to retrieve a ""secret file"" knowing none exists but also sends a poisoner and a cut throat at the same time.  Somebody succeeds killing the rival but the players are blamed for the murder while in the residence looking for the file and treasures.    This would turn up the heat to 11 if the players are caught near the crime scene with any stolen contraband or are seen entering or leaving the home."
1544,While it isn’t little known  A lot of people think the Honda CRZ is a big turd. But it’s actually a really good car. It isn’t like a Prius  the motors are basically there for extra power and torque  but people believe otherwise.  It also is a great platform  with a solid chassis  sweet interior  and excellent looks in my opinion. :)  And because no one likes them  they’re very cheap for what they are.  After showing my friends a lot of details  they have all changed their stance on the CRZ.   Happy driving! -Micah
1545,"Spend some time learning the business and getting a feel for how data science or modeling can help solve pain points that specific teams or departments face.  Build credibility and relationships in order to scope out some potential workstreams.  This will involve a lot of discipline and self-motivation.  Tactically  there are many ways to solve a given problem  and there is a wide spectrum of possible methods between ""cutting edge deep learning"" and ""calculating averages.""  Aim for somewhere in the middle so you get the chance to learn something new or interesting while still not overcomplicating things with a non-usable solution.  If you're the first DS then you'll have wide latitude to select the appropriate tool."
1546,"Just as context. For a director I'm still on the younger side (not quite 30) having mostly worked in programs aimed at teaching (masters program to train people in all areas of teamwork  accelerator  etc.) 4 projects between 4 months and 1 5 years. 7 - 15 people in the core team all of us working full time on it. I've chosen this path and very long ""education"" because I'm aiming to make my way into AA or AAA direction.   ---  **The most important thing when directing your team is to get every single person working as efficiently as possible towards the best possible product**  Ok. Neat line. But I don't think you're asking to get an abstract  single line response so let me break this down a bit more.  Let's start with the best possible product. Realistically you're never free to make whatever you want. There's always limitations  demands from upper management or if you're alone the need to sell enough games to keep working.  So you're researching a lot about what type of game can work and basically start by creating marketing materials for a not yet made product. A pitch. This pitch is usually quite short and just roughly touching what you're making. The purest form of what you will keep doing for the rest of the project. Be clear enough so everyone works towards the same thing but vague enough so all the specialized people can make it better. However  behind this somewhat short pitch you have done market research  looked at how to best market it during pitching and towards players when you get closer to release. You've estimated development time  necessary budget  risks about what is unknown. Considered the skills you have on the team  the software and tools available. There's a lot of work behind it most people never see  including the people on your team because often they won't be interested in these aspects and it's truly not relevant for their job. More about that later.  Ideally you have built this with 2 - 3 people. It's always good to have your art director  lead programmer and lead game designer on board. You won't always have that luxury but it really helps. I mean  the art director can also pretty up your ugly a** presentation by starting up the graphics package. But they will also be able to do much better mood boards and if you got someone good be drastically better in developing a rough style and estimate the development effort for it. Same with the game designer and programmer. It's good to have the leads know each other and collaborate closely early on so they understand and trust each other well when you go into production. Again they draft up rough sketches of what will be necessary  etc. Help you evaluate risks  add ideas that make the project better and more efficient to develop. Having people to come up with ideas  questioning your ideas and making sure it's as bullet proof and understandable as possible is invaluable. Training the people around you to question you the right amount will make a world of difference. Obviously "
1547,Tiamat in that show is kind of a ‘plot encounter’ though.  Basically the equivalent of a cRPG where you fight a boss early in the introduction that is interrupted by an NPC or event  then you have the ‘real’ fight with them several hours later.  I’m running DCC and it’s ‘old school’ in that balancing is the DM’s job and there’s no real tools to do it. I hang on to the old AD&D toolset of having an NPC show up  having monsters act less competently if they’re steamrolling the PCs  and trying to eyeball things.
1548,Way of shadows monk is basically a ninja with one of the best debuff attacks in the game.  Shadow bloodline sorcerer is a mage that is exceptionally good at debuffing enemies.  College of whispers bard is an illusionist mage with good support abilities.  Illusionist wizard is a mage with tons and tons of utility and options.  Be aware that the *darkness* spell (and similar abilities) cut both ways. Your allies need to see the enemy to attack them.
1549,NOTE:  Turns out the IS-60 EVO is just the IS-47K but without the 120mm fan on top.  However  it appears the IS-47K does not have any fan mounts to support the 120mm fan. If you wanna use a 120mm fan on it  you're gonna have to get creative.
1550,"I am always an advocate for the ""talk to them"" option first.  So  stop hinting. No more vagueness  have a direct conversation with the player. Calm. Mature. Direct.  Tell him what he's doing that is annyoing you  and ask him to stop it.  If he refuses  then you access him to just leave  because he's sapping the fun out of the game.  Also  on-to-one  not in front of everyone. This can after still be solved in a friendly way  but having an audience can spoil that."
1551,If I asked this question  it would be to see if someone understood A/B testing and experimental design  not necessarily multiple regression.  E.g.  recommend the same video with a short title and a long title  and see which generates more views (up to some arbitrary significance level). Regression might be useful for slicing up *which* users prefer longer title length and if its related to the type/content of the video. This means we could ask uploaders for a short and a long title (recommended action)  and if the other variables line up  use the long title. We could also nudge them for a 'more descriptive' title at upload  if the length is below some cutpoint we found.   I like your take  but you also correctly diagnosed a problem with that analysis. Recommending action. I'm not hiring data scientists  just working with them. Good luck!
1552,"May not be applicable across the entire lineup but at least some recent Hyundai interiors are not quite on par with Toyota from a durability perspective. I believe savagegeese calls this out in his somewhat recent Sonata video. Like it's designed to photograph and test drive exceptionally favorably  but there are doubts about how it will look in 5 years.   Also as someone who had a late 90s golden era Nissan  any ""modern"" (2003+) just comes up a bit short in terms of materials and build quality. Had a 99 Altima and a 08 Rogue. Keeping it to strictly interior materials  fit and finish  the Altima was the superior car. That said - had the Rogue for about 9 years (before the CVT did what Nissan CVTs do) and it help up. I guess maybe that's the one thing about fisher price plastics - ugly as sin  but last pretty well.   Going into the history books a little bit  my family had a 2002 Daewoo Leganza. This is the car that I WISH was built with Fisher Price plastics  maybe it would have lasted longer. We had one for about 8y/95k mi and anything plastic didn't hold up particularly well for very long."
1553,I've worked at 3 well known studios in the past 15 years and made great money. They are all ended the same. I would leave looking for greener pastures. I'm now doing remote contract work and a side project with friends and I have never been happier! Game dev is a great job but shit bosses alway seem determined to push out good empoyees. Work for yourself if you want to be happy.
1554,I've recently been inspired to run a couple grim fairy tale games for Halloween  and was wondering if anyone knew of any good games or supplements which run in that kind of setting  or at least borrow heavily from those themes.
1555,Hi  I'm trying to gather the check engine codes from the obd1 system. I know how to jump the connector and read numbers based on the blinking lights and stuff  but don't know what conditions need to be meet before codes are actually registered? How far or how long do I have to drive the car before errors are actually detected?  Thanks
1556,Five **dirt cheap** power supplies are tested by Hardware Busters. It is nice to have reviews of some highly affordable PSUs that no one ever bothers to test. Price range from 15 ($18) to 35 ($41.5) euros! This is episode one  so more are on the way.  [https://youtu.be/BIpag-FUrrk](https://youtu.be/BIpag-FUrrk)
1557,"This is very  very system dependent  but no  I'd say generally they don't need to be the same. Something like D&D it's generally good to be within a few levels of each other. Something like RuneQuest on the other hand it's pretty easy to lose track of who is is ""higher level""  and it probably won't matter much anyway. Smallville laughs in the face of power levels."
1558,Unfortunately  not finding a job in games is very common. What you should do in the meantime depends more on your education and previous experience than anything other developers can tell you. Contract work as a graphic designer or as a programmer could be relevant  depending on which side of that line you're better at. There are tech-artist like jobs in other media companies  but the actual combination is going to be rarer.
1559,FWIW - I listen to a lot of podcasts where data science leaders talk to this question  and they all say the same thing (my philosophy as well) - demonstrating the ability and the acumen to solve a business problem is > having a piece of paper that says you *should* be able to it. Although a piece of paper can’t hurt if the experience has given you the grounding to develop the needed skills
1560,Eventhough I have yet to play it I feel like call of cthulu would probably be my pick if I was allowed to house rule it.  Based on my reading it has a few problems  but it can do the 3 setting types I like to run (horror  fantasy  and science fiction) and it wouldn't get in the way too much while I try and design around it.  I have every generic system on the market  but I dislike them all for different reasons that end up being pretty core to the experience.  I think genesys would probably be my favourite?  I think the dice are cool and I can work around that.
1561,10cm?!?!?!? Don't drive it. You might have prestone in the oil. Was your vehicuke smoking white while you drove it? Could be a egr cooler or a headgasket problem.  Also when you'll drain it  drain it all and put new oil in. As well as a new filter. But you need to make sure there's no underlying problem to it
1562,Depends on the business use case. If you're trying to figure out what changes month-to-month  then model it month-to-month. If you're trying to categorize the data for analysis downstream  then having static topics can be helpful.
1563,>For a little background on me  I love/am interested in all cars but don’t consider myself to be very knowledgeable on cars in general. I don’t want to make a fool of myself but at the same time would love to meet the legend.  That's totally fine. At least you're self-aware  and now just don't be the idiot who pretends to know more than they actually do to try to impress someone. If anything have him teach you something.   Also he's Magnus Walker  I feel like most everyone would only want to talk about cars with him  maybe having a conversation with someone who isn't as into cars  and isn't going to try to have the conversation centred around that would be a nice change for him  >a family member set it up to go talk and see some of his collection.  Depending on what kind of strings this relative pulled to make this opportunity happen for you  it might reflect kind of poorly on them to ask favours to set something like this up  and then for you to not go (I'm asian  and I know culturally we would see it this way)
1564,The rumors about 128MB cache looks really  really interesting. Seems very unlikely  though.  Then again  who predicted GDDR6X? I didn't.  I would love to know more if it's true. What improvements could be possible? Where would we see it? Mostly in lower res or in 4K as well? For what it could be used? Maybe it could allow for things which were out of reach in traditional designs? OK  enough of this dreaming  let's get back to Earth. This is very unlikely. 128MB is a lot. Costs a lot. Doesn't look like something for gaming card.
1565,"My suggestion: choose the right system. It can do much  for you  'cause if you want the travel to have a big role in your fiction  you'll need a system highlighting it.   Ryuutama was already suggested.   I suggest Ironsworn plus its supplement Delve. Great mechanics  great mood  lot of freedom. Also  the corebook is free. Finally  not in your requests  it can be played cooperative (ie. There's no a single GM  or no GM at all  so you use ""Oracles"" as inspiration  even when generating locations to explore 🙂).  Good game."
1566,There is something called [derating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derating).  It is a way of trading off component lifetime by running them at a fraction of their rated current/voltage/temperature.  This reduces the overall stress and can prolong component lifetime.    So in a sense the higher capacity PSU are built with higher ratings components  so using them below their capacity is a form of derating.  The components see less heat due to lower current so that helps reducing some of the stress.  As to how much  one have to do the necessary calculations.  There are various charts  tables for these kind of things such as  [MIL-STD 975M](https://www.scribd.com/document/270119217/Mil-Std-975m) (military standard on component selection) as well as calculators etc.
1567,It's not really a single trick  but method chaining changed my workflow overnight. It's a tiny bit harder to debug  but makes everything so much more readable and logical. Great blog post on it [here](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining)  rest of the series is good too.

1569,An enticing bargain should be for something they desperately need or want  and it should be difficult for them to get that anywhere else.  You can also make it seem as if what they will pay is innocuous.  Ultimately  if your players always turn them down  let them. Then let them feel the consequences. Turned down a djinn's offer to reach the desert city of Amanaptra before their rivals? Maybe the djinn gets pissed at their middle finger and chooses to teach them a lesson by offering the same deal to the rivals.  If you have or haven't  watch the Magicians on SyFy. Specifically the first few episodes of season 2 and pay attention to Penny's interactions with the man at the river. It's a good template for handling players who give middle fingers.
1570,I'm currently in the process of beginning a master's degree in data science. This is a career change for me so I don't have much background in this type of work. I understand that job specs are extremely dependent on employer/field  but based on anyone's experience how frequently are data scientist positions remote friendly  and if so are they fully remote  remote as needed  etc?
1571,Not every character is going to be a perfect person. Some people are flawed and if it pisses you off that characters are flawed and sometimes do things that aren't nice then that's on you. I really enjoyed the first episode personally  but that doesn't mean you will. Just try it out and drop it if you dislike it.
1572,It's still super far away so fuck off and stop asking  here's a screenshot  buy our other games   - Ubisoft
1573,**I'm the designer of** [**KILLSLASH**](https://longgames.itch.io/killslash)**  a new single-player journaling RPG** where you assume the role of a legendary killer in a slasher movie. As you hunt and attack your victims  you'll document your murders and learn more about yourself and your victims.  Check it out here: [https://longgames.itch.io/killslash](https://longgames.itch.io/killslash)  During the game  you will choose four victims  answer questions about them  roll dice to attack them  and then roll dice to see how they react. You’ll then describe what happens in as much gory detail as you’d like.  If you enjoy reading or writing horror stories  or if you like to describe characters deaths in RPG's in over-the-top  gruesome ways  then we made this game for you!  It's similar to other journaling RPGs such as *Thousand Year Old Vampire* and *Artefact*.  If this is the kind of game you're interested in  check it out on our website: [https://longgames.co.uk/killslash](https://longgames.co.uk/killslash)  Or on itch.io: [https://longgames.itch.io/killslash](https://longgames.itch.io/killslash)  It is also available on Drive Thru RPG: [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329274/Killslash](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329274/Killslash)  Thanks!

1574,To be clear  I realize that this is subjective but I want to hear opinions and what people usually do since I want to install aeros on my car for the first time. Btw  by aeros I mean side lip and front lip.  Should it match your body color  or black? If black  matte or gloss?
1575,A common application in this space is in the advanced variants of the page rank algorithm for use in profilers and recommender systems. FANG companies are especially active in this field.  Another increasingly popular application in this field is the detection of bad actors in a network.  For both applications  key challenges include scalability and privacy -- handling large streams of network data via approximations and distributed computing in differentially private models.

1577,I can only imagine this leading to an adverse effect
1578,PS5 can't even run it's flagship titles at 4k/60. How can it be the biggest leap? Only leap we're seeing this generation is extremely mild ray tracing with sub 60fps framerates or identical levels of IQ than last generation but at 4k/60+ fps.
1579,"As someone who has practiced data science for over 6 years and helped teach it for 4 years  **I will say that the** [**imposter syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) **never really goes away** (in fact  it often gets worse because you become more aware of how big the space is!). I deal with this by saying... life is long! I can slowly master the areas I'm interested in over the course of my life (there's no rush!).  Here are my textbook recommendations:  \- Start with ISLR - [http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)   \- Attempt ELS - [https://web.stanford.edu/\~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) \- but know that you're going to probably have gaps in your math knowledge. Zoom in and debug those  really make sure you understand it.  Then  use Google  Youtube  whatever to fill in gaps  see the problem from multiple angles  and also laugh along the way as you see the same math object written in 4 different sets of notation!  Here's my advice on learning data science:  \- It's tempting to treat learning somewhat linearly or causally. ""If I read this book really well and do all the exercises  then I will have learned the material!"" but that's really not true! I would instead say that books / lectures / MOOC's are very good at building a strong foundation / helping you absorb the core principles. But after that  you really learn by doing. Doing projects  doing data science in a lab or in industry  getting feedback  and iterating. I forgot which artist said this  but a famous quote is ""learn the rules well  then learn when to break them"". For example  when applying linear regression to real world problems ... the [assumptions that OLS requires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Assumptions) VERY rarely hold true. But you have to be flexible in your thinking while still maintaining statistical rigor. No textbook teaches you this! Most books / courses teach clean principles in a clean perfect universe that doesn't really exist!  \- Spend way more time on projects  labs  and exercises than on proofs. I love proofs and you should definitely go deep in the proofs that interest you. But even ML practitioners and ML PhD students often learn the math ""just in time"" (I'm friends with quite a few). It's much more interesting and valuable to build deep intuition for how algorithms work. Using Python  R  and Mathematica (which facilitates ""playing"" of math super well) extensively to build intuition using a simulation first approach is very powerful. Nassim Taleb has a PhD in quant finance and he still claims to have learned a lot from Mathematica / simulating / playing: [https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1153953385655283712?lang=en](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1153953385655283712?lang=en)"
1580,For any big budget creative endeavor there is always the last minute dash to the finish line. Especially when there is a hard date to meet. The truth of the matter is that as long as the game industry doesn’t have the unions like you see in other entertainment businesses you will see abuses of this ‘crunch period’  That said I think the two sides of the coin are CDPR meant to say they are not going to abuse crunch time and run their employees ragged and sick. But they didn’t say that they said something more broad and it’s now biting them in the ass. I think the statement that there is an ‘ideological narrative’ is probably true. If you think that these sorts of creative endeavors won’t ever encounter such a period of crunch then you’re wrong. Murphy’s Law is always in effect and even if you plan plan plan you will still be picking up pieces all the way to the finish line.   I’ve heard a saying in filmmaking (from more realistic filmmakers) that goes: I’ll believe it when it’s on the screen. For me this speaks to that endless struggle to overcome the great mountain you’ve set for yourself. And I think that’s how people need to understand crunch time. Yes. There are absolutely people and companies who abuse it. In all industries. However  being no means their autobiographer  I do feel pretty familiar with CDPR as a company and they don’t seem interested in pushing people beyond their limits or crushing their employees spirits. I mean  how long has Cyberpunk been in development? And this is a AAA studio  and they had the success of the Witcher 3 to follow up.   Maybe I’m wrong about that. I do think this whole thing with the minute people hear ‘crunch time’ they start reaching for the pitchforks is just misinformed and naive.
1581,Samsung has made a good comeback from seemingly falling behind TSMC to getting Nvidia and Qualcomm  though I'm sure they are not making as much money as they would like from these deals. Overall good thing for everybody if we can have 2 players in the bleeding edge business instead of just 1.
1582,At one point or another I have browsed facebook  craigslist  ebay  and importers for every single car on that list and I was born in 2000 lol.  Legendary cars don't just suddenly become unlegendary. Id bet money in 30 years young car enthusiasts will still learn about the E30  the Golf R  the Supra (A80)  and a loooooooong list of other legends. They'll probably also lust after BRZs and 350zs. And complain about all the people who gutted the interiors to make shitty drift missiles and now want 15 000 for a 30 year old car with no AC or interior.
1583,It'd be quite funny if Ampere does better in rasterizatoin than in RT after all is said and done.  I'm expecting the performance to be decent enough not to deflate the hype completely but nvidia might be thinking of going TSMC for a quick refresh.
1584,Meh  still terrible support and we all know how bad the drivers will be. Also far underperforms compared to 30-series. Wake me up when AMD cares about consumers and gaming and actually makes something worthwhile.
1585,I made a thread speculating where Big Navi will end up and one variable still in air was the memory bandwidth  turning out to be quite the wildcard   https://np.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/in15wu/my_best_average_and_worst_case_predictions_for/g44lpcb/
1586,Hi Guys    A question  are people still using ANOVA and mutual information tests? Or are we doing feature selection on other techniques such as permutation feature importance and shapley values?  I have not found a good resource that compares that classical statistical approaches to the ones that are often quoted in current learning resources (feature importance  shapley value magnitude  or just creating a linear model and looking at the p-values)
1587,"I'm interested that nobody has mentioned *theme* yet. Being the game for ""Adventurers in a Tolkienesque landscape"" is a serious coup  considering how genre-defining Tolkien's own work has been. There may be others but if you're the first  and you're in a popular genre for nerds then I think there's a lot going for your. Another commenter mentioned that the only time D&D want the number 1 it was 2nd place to Pathfinder. Meanwhile  I believe (sorry  don't have statistics) that the number 1 in Japan is Call of Cthulhu. Is European medieval fantasy big in Japan?"
1588,And I read today  11th Gen rocket lake is getting launched soon. Then what the heck is 11th Gen tiger Lake? People at Intel gone nuts? It's been half a decade they are drilling holes into their own brand!
1589,If you can find it  check out The Cockpit. It's a collection of shorts about WW2 air combat. It's pretty rare though.  Another one that comes to mind is In This Corner of the World. That one focuses more on the home front in Japan.
1590,Idk if you have co-ops with gas stations but both costco and sams club has really good prices on gas  especially 93 octane. I've tried using rewards through shell  local grocery store rewards  and gas buddy and nothing beats just going to Costco to fill up.
1591,First of all..  My most anticipated anime of Fall 2020 is finally here  I cant believe I become someone waiting for a new season of a shounen anime to this and I totally not regret it.   CAWFEES FOR EVERYONE!
1592,Location - UK   Price range £10 000 max   Transmission- Manual   New or used - Used  Must haves - Shorter than 3.5 Meters  Sorry for not following the format correctly  a lot of it isn’t relevant  looking for a short car as I want to take it on a ~ 6 month road trip round Europe once COVIDs finished. Want it to be short so that it’s easier to park in cities. I currently have an R50 Mini Cooper and I love it but would like to see if there’s anything shorter that I would be interested in. Obvious answer is a smart car but they’re slow and boring and if I’m going to be driving thousands of miles I’d like something a little bit more fun. Don’t need a tonne of boot space what’s as I pack super light. The boot space in my mini is plenty. Car needs two seats  4 is a waste.  Thanks in advance.
1593,   I'm in high school right now and was doing some research on data science. I wanted to ask what undergraduate degree you took to get into Data Science  and what the field is like. What do you do on a day to day basis and how does it help your company? I don't think your degree matters much  as you could have a SE or a Data Science degree and it'll be the same  but **please correct me if I'm wrong**.  P.S: If they're any Canadians here  I'd love to hear your input on your university  job  and why you took it.
1594,* You could start with people or events which inspire you. And use that to build a historical  alt-hist  or inspiring low fantasy campaign.  * You could start with real legends which inspire you. And use that to build an inspiring high-fantasy campaign.  * You could start with an established setting  and rework it.  * You could decide myths aren't consistent  so your world probably shouldn't be consistent either. That was Greg Stafford's approach in Runequest and Pendragon.  * You could look up some of Phil McGregor's reference works. e.g. Orbis Mundi 2 and Farm Forge & Steam.
1595,I have a degree in math and science and higher level degrees and if I must be honest I don’t think I like the idea of going 20-40k more in debt for a masters in data science. How likely are you to hire self taught  especially if they get certifications along the way and build a portfolio in this git hub website thing?  (As well as in any IT field since one doesn’t normally go right into data science)
1596,For me it would be Fate (Condensed as that's pretty much Core with everything good in Accelerated integrated as a regular or optional rule). I know I would totally get bored if I played just one system  even if it was my favorite system. Every now and then  I need that nice jolt from Dungeon Crawl Classics  or structure of story from PbtA moves  or the creative discussion of stakes of Forged in the Dark. But if I had to pick just one  it would be Fate.
1597,I recently did this exact thing. 1970 camaro  originally a 350ci mated to TH350.   Bought a 383 crate motor from blueprint and a complete T56 kit from silver sport. The TKO is a more finicky install due to input/output shaft alignment  and creates opportunity for more difficult shifts. I am 120% satisfied with the T56.   And silversport provides a trans hump  templates  shifter  etc with detailed instructions for instillation. No extra parts were needed. Even included new speedo cables  wiring for reverse lockout etc!   My 2c  you will seriously double spend converting to manual behind a 350  then going to LS. It sucks  but do everything at once. I waited an extra 2 years to do everything at once and don’t regret it at all.
1598,I've been following fuel cells for a while.  When you can refill  they're great. The Clarity fuel cell gets about 280 miles per tank (real world  EPA is 300+)  and filling up takes about 5 minutes. The main issue as other have pointed out is the limited amount of stations. The fuel is pricey but every company is subsidizing it right now. ($10-18/kg and it's about 4.5kg to fill up) Most give you a $15k fuel card. You can pickup a CPO Toyota Mirai for $15k or so and it comes with a $15k fuel card.   Limited stations  subsidized fuel  and relatively cheap ownership cost has created somewhat of an imbalance here in California. Not uncommon to see long lines of 7-8 cars at certain stations. Hot days also requires time so the compressors can catch up with the load. Another issue with refueling was the freezing handles  but that's been resolved with newer designs.  Last year a hydrogen production facility in northern california had an explosion that caused a major shortage. There were long lines everywhere and very limited fuel. Toyota and Honda were offering free rentals to compensate.
1599,Without getting into too much detail  someone close to me has died recently and it feels awful  so I don't want to watch anything really sad that would remind me of that. What are your recommendations for good anime where I wouldn't have to worry about that?
1600,So many rewatchers freaking out about Higurashi.  How are the new viewers supposed to know those are spoilers?  Why are you expanding upon what the anime spoiled  lol?  I've seen so many freak out and then explain in detail all the reasons why it's a spoiler  doing more damage then if you would have let new watchers figure it out from the season.   This comes from someone who has never watched Higurashi but because of someone on FB all the answer arc from the last series/ is ruined because they were so worried new watchers wouldn't get why it was spoilers. 🤦
1601,If they hadn't made such a big deal about how they weren't gonna have crunch again and presenting themselves as the good guys constantly then there would be a lot less backlash. Most people understand that from what we know the workers are well compensated and not overworked to a ridiculous degree. CDPR just had to make promises they then went back on though.
1602,Given Newegg and other retailers are saying website traffic was greater than black Friday for the launch of the 3080 it sounds like that stock will production constrained for a while. The Fabs only have so much capacity to split across many clients.    I wonder how well AMD will do with production given they are using TMSC who has had production capacity issues in the past.  This might be part of why Nvidia went with Samsung fabs instead of TMSC. If they were fighting AMD for Fab capacity production could have ended up being even more constrained than it already is.
1603,I edit 4k raw video (32bit exr sequences)  I shuffle jobs on and off my SSD every few days. Over the past 7 years I have written 140TB to my drive. The idea that a console user who downloads a game and has it sit there stationary for months or years is ever going to hit 600TB is a non-issue.
1604,Big Gundam fan and I've seen practically all of them (everything but the BuildFighters/Divers and SD  and I mean everything). I've watched Evangelion  RahXephon  Full Metal Panic  Code Geass  Gurren Lagann  Gasaraki  Macross/Robotech  The Big O  Votoms.  Mainly  I was hoping the kind folks in this sub might have some recs for this!  I'm REALLY not into romance stuff  or just outwardly pervy stuff (i.e. Darling and the Franxx  and Aquarion to a degree).  I feel like I don't know what to check out. HALP.  P.S. also a big fan of most Production I.G stuff  Ghost in the Shell etc.  And sci-fi stuff like Akira etc. So I'd even settle for some mega sci-fi stuff  if I've already exhausted the mecha. Seen all the classics like Bebop  Trigun  Gungrave  etc.
1605,Because a z still handles a lot better and has much better steering. And na the interior on a camaro is still ass  typical gm quality there. and idk yea its the “base” model  its like trying to drive a tank and I find them ugly.   Edit: also its not always about numbers as well  a z feels much better to drive and is a better “experience” than a v6 camaro. See also why the Miata is the best  selling roadster and one of the top selling sports cars of all time despite having dinky ass 4 cylinder engines
1606,Yes  context matters. If someone is giving the MPG of a VW Polo you could probably assume UK MPG and vice-versa for the MPG of Silverado/Ram/F-Series.   On a similar note I wish people would differentiate USD  AUD  or CAD more when talking about prices. The US Dollar is pretty much the universal currency as far as how often it's traded on top of this being a US based site with predominantly American users. If you're talking about price and don't add that you're using AUD or CAD it greatly over-inflates the price.
1607,"I mostly play DnD but and looking to expand out into more skill based games.   The most recommended I have found are Call of Cthulu 7e  MG Travellers 2e  and Cyberpunk Red. I was wanting to cast a wider net to find others that might have been passed by by my broad google search.   For specifications sake  by skill based i mean a game system that gives you growth through the betterment of your skills not by leveling up just so you are suddenly more powerful with all new abilities and more health that you didnt have 5xps ago.  Edit: I would still like combat to be in the game  just that combat is very dangerous and it would have to be taken seriosly and played tactically but it is still an indepth part of the game  this would rule out games like ""Tales from the Loop"" and ""Kids on Bikes""."
1608,I've been learning python and have had many roadblocks along the way. but as an employed data scientist how often are you googling questions about code or syntax etc..?  Is this appropriate or this there an idea that you need to be competent to a high degree before being in the workplace?
1609,Kaguya-sama love is war  Nisekoiand Re:Life for the romcom animes.  Then for anime that are more romance than comedy there's Oregairu  Rascal does not dream of bunny senpai  Clannad  White Album 2  Steins Gate and Re:Zero.  If you don't mind yuri/shounen-ai there's Given  Bloom into you and Adachi to Shimamura (it's currently airing so for now we have only one episode).
1610,One thing is clear  even if MSI merely has mud on their face.  The 3000 release  thusfar  has been a complete fustercluck.  Big NAVI must really be something for nvidia to be rushing everything.  That's all I can envision.
1611,I was stugying frontend and found out that I dont like it after not doing well at a interview.  Create beautiful pages look like the scratch they sent is not that cool.  So im back  I like to train models and I think I like working with data due to some college experiences.  Do you guys have any suggestion on how to begin again and stay up to date with DS? I like to read books.  Background: 22 old finishing computer engineering college  working with marketing at a well know startup in South america.
1612,I doubt they even care about that.... a lot of manufacturers just pump fake engines noises in. That Aston Martin probably sounds different because a lot of turboed engines have much smaller displacement  and you’re just used to the sound
1613,"There are several rules of that type used for wargames  check litko  for instance.  [https://litko.net/collections/movement-gauges-rulers](https://litko.net/collections/movement-gauges-rulers)  I have a ""measuring tool"" for DBA that has 2 to 5 inches sides  in wood  that is quite nice  and might be of help  [**https://litko.net/products/deluxe-dbx-movement-gauge-set**](https://litko.net/products/deluxe-dbx-movement-gauge-set)  And you can use the same concept for any scale you want  just get a piece of wood and a handsaw  and you are done"
1614,Everybody going bat shit crazy over this is ridiculous. PS4 controller WILL work on PS5 just not for PS5 games which are going to be designed with Dualsense features in mind. Every backwards compatible games CAN be played with DS4. Plus you get the Dualsense in the box  what is the problem here?
1615,What a [misleading graph](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WajsiTUZSDgSH5UPHrG4Ee-650-80.png).  That sine-like wave has a period of ~14 dots at 8000 Hz or a frequency of ~570 Hz. No one twitches that fast in a coordinated and productive manner.  ---  I feel like any miniscule gain by ramping up to 8000 Hz is negated by having a wire. No matter how good the mouse bungee  it and the cable are both applying small but not negligible amounts of force on the mouse  and the amount of force varies depending on location  speed  and orientation.
1616,The sheet mentions charts  but too bad there aren't any trying to show some kind of relationship (queerness/gender and salary  location and salary  etc).  We've also seen similar datasets:  * [Blizzard salaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/i3aq7w/blizzard_workers_share_salaries_in_revolt_over/g0b7op6/) ([charts comparing disciplines](https://imgur.com/a/OBG7Fch))  * [anonymous UK game dev salaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/at2519/anonymous_uk_game_dev_salaries/)
1617,Seriously  Shin Etsu Silicon Grease is magic. I've started getting some squeaks and groans from one of my doors and this thing fixed it right up.  I've wiped all rubber gaskets/seals clean with a damp paper towel  dried them up  applied a moderate amount of silicon grease and rubbed it in gently with a clean cotton rag  removing the excess. No mess! Boom - no more weird noises!
1618,"Please don't confuse your DM style and ability with the ability of your system to make combat engaging.  Combat being tedious and boring  falls more on the shoulders of the players than the DM.  Players who aren't ready when their turn comes don't know the rules and need to look things up on their turn and don't act quickly to resolve their combat turn.  I once had a player who took one minute each time he was asked to roll a dice.  Seriously  a minute!  He loved the fact that the attention was on him and made little jokes  searched for dice  and other things because he could while the attention was on him.   That made combat VERY slow.  My advice is that you do two things.  Determine why you have combat.  If it isn't moving the story forward or providing some significant role-playing thing to the game  skip it.  It isn't needed. Combat is not required unless it moves the story forward or provides some story elements.  (which can be the players using their abilities  if that is part of the game like it is in D&D)  Second  combat being tedious and boring is likely because it isn't moving fast enough. Become much more militant about how long players can take on their 'turn.'  Demand that they are ready for their turn before their turn arrives—none of this ""Ok  what can I do"" crap.  You be ready when your turn comes  you do it quickly  and we move to the next person.  This will greatly reduce the tediousness of combat because rather than waiting around  players will feel pressured to be ready.  Forcing things to keep moving will make the players work hard and spend less time sitting around waiting.  Visual aids greatly slow play  so if your system doesn't require a grid and minis  drop that idea and move to the theater of the mind. That makes combat more descriptive and less hex/square-based.  Note: my preferred system requires minis and grids  so I use them.  Finally  be more descriptive about the hits and damage that both the NPCs and players do.  In other words  the player says  ""18  hit  for 6 points of damage"".  You reply with a description  ""You get a solid hit on the Orc  but do little damage as your blow strikes a well-armored area.""  or if 6 points is a lot  ""You get a solid blow on the Orc  cause a large amount of damage that staggers him a bit.  A few more of those  and the Orc will go down.""  I warn you that you shouldn't really let the players make up those descriptions because every blow will be amazing  and the description from the player will be like  ""I leap from the table  swing on the tapestry  do a triple backflip landing right in front of the Orc and piercing him with my sword right in the chest causing massive damage and the Orc screams in terror  1 point of damage."" Facepalm."
1619,I just picked up a 4k/60hz monitor. I needed it more for work than gaming. Currently using a GTX 1650  so obviously not gaming anytime soon. Based on this  a 3080 seems like logical value - but am I wrong to think a 3080 is needed in order to play most titles at a steady 60 fps? I'm not looking to play Control with RTX enabled at 60fps  more like Witcher 3 and Tomb Raider  Sports Games  and a bit of Dota 2 and other popular games. My goal is visual quality and smoothness  not raw FPS at 360hz. I've been using 1080p/60 for a million years.  I'm thinking either the 3070  Big Navi  or 3080 would be my best best.
1620,About the >I would like to know why the PSA sells well in Argentina... here in Brazil the automaker has reputation of unreliability and expensive maintenance and repair costs.  I bet that they don't have the prejudice (for the lack of a better word) we have against french automakers. For quite a few years it has been a PSA or Renault model that had the cheapest maintenance rate for new cars  according to the car media at least.
1621,Does anybody know of any family-friendly streams/podcasts of sci-fi rpgs? I recently discovered the Silhouette Zero podcast  but aside from that  I don't really know where to start looking. I'm particularly interested in Traveller or Paranoia actual plays  but Star Wars or really any other sci-fi is cool too.
1622,Call the dealership back and present the findings from the shop that showed significant flood damage. Be VERY aggressive  dont let them bullshit you. Get them to refund your money and return the car  or else ______(you have many options).   And no 65yo used car salesman is honest  gimme a fkn break. He's not out playing bridge he's there to make you feel good buying a POS car because he needs money.
1623,For years we've heard from automakers that people didn't really want an electric car  so they didn't bother making one. Porsche  with one of the richest heritages and staunchest fan-base of any car just proved that theory dead.
1624,Certificates that you can work with AWS or Google Cloud Solutions. In my experience these are also the certificates that actually teach you something useful.  &#x200B   Of course  certificates from online courses could be more educational  but the certificate from the common courses are a meme at this point.
1625,Should have happened a long time ago.   Tencent  owned by a high ranking CCP official and member of the “People’s’ Congress” is merely another highly successful part of the Chinese intelligence community. It has also used its influence developers to give their games a pro Chinese slant.   Fucking idiots in the West willing to sell their souls for a free game that they wouldn’t have otherwise played.
1626,Build a causal graph of all the associated factors. Then test the strength of association using structural equations. Discover casual relationships using conditioning experiments. Read Robins or Pearl about causal frameworks.
1627,Please start with a VR based space MMO using an engine like I-novae or no mans sky.  Add in factorio / space engineer / satisfactory style building  Throw in deep story on par with Cyberpunk  Best game ever.  Imagine being in a stargate like universe with billions of galaxies and billions of stars and planets in each galaxy.  You start off in some remote galaxy  a galaxy that’s just for you  with AI factions.  First 40 - 100 hours is basically single player  and gets you the tech needed to get in the intergalactic transport network.  After that  it’s all open world pvp.  Maybe break down the universe in some unique way to allow your starting area basically not destructible  while giving your typical markets and shared space areas.  Maybe a “fire upon the deep” style universe  pvp mainly takes place in the beyond   raid type stuff in the transcend  and then your over stuff like your personal starting spot is in the slow zone (inside it).  (Maybe you find alien tech as part of your single player start  that basically is cloning or teleportation - giving you unique control to move back and forth from your specific slow zone to the beyond.
1628,I feel this hard. I was used to feeling very challenged and overextended in my PhD program  but now I feel like what I’m doing in my new data analyst position is basic reporting. I won’t to do some more data science type work and predictive inferential analysis but my supe is asking me to wait a few months more.
1629,I'm a student at a top university in Canada where a major in Data Science is offered. It's highly competitive (they take about 17 people per term) and so I never thought I'd actually get accepted but I did end up getting accepted. However  since this is not a major offered by a lot of industries  I was wondering how my degree would be recognized in the industry.    Will I still end up getting data analyst jobs until I pursue a master's?    Or will I be able to get a position as a data scientist in companies?   Also  I wanted to add that research is not something I'm thinking of pursuing.  Another thing I wanted to add is I'm an international student and so pursuing a data science major would increase my fees by 10K CAD whereas I could end up doing a degree in statistics with a minor in computing for 10K less than the DS major. However  the financial aspect is not as significant so please let me know about your take on this.
1630,As long as you're not talking about a 5 person shop  the CEO/CMO aren't going to be the people actually executing on ideas or projects.  Those will be probably be the product managers  marketing managers  engineers  etc who handle the day-to-day operations.  Talk to those guys to get a sense of what their pain points are  what sorts of problems they're concerned about  then think of ways to help them with data-driven insights or automation.  Think about how they might take action on the product of your labor  then get their buy in.  If it's too hard to incorporate into their decision making process then you have to either scrap it or simplify the scope of your problem.
1631,I tell you the only way I know how  but you are not going to like the answer: Be the producer  the boss  the man who pays them for their work.  As long as I pay my collaborators  I have the power I need over our deal. If I don't like the art  I have a say in it.  Since they didn't do the art and put the work into it because we were polite to each other  but because there is 20€ in it for him to make it good  and make it in time. Quality will suffer if you cannot get your artists to do revisions. If they don't like it  there is just no shortage of others who do. (Although best not to switch artists or programmers mid-project for a myriad of reasons.)  There is also the vision. Ideally in a team everyone has the same vision of what the game should look like  played like  and be experienced in general. In reality however  these opinions will differentiate while the project goes ahead and new ideas need to be implemented  vague things have to be specified. It helps if there is a final authority who is allowed to pick from the options when no common agreement is reached.    Guess who is that authority? The guy who pays.  I know this is not what you wanted to hear  you hoped there might be a cool discord server or a secret sub-reddit where fully trustworthy and skill people gather  working on games together in harmony till release  but that just simply not how collaboration works 90% of the time. I understand  so did I  but commitment is a very valuable thing that is pretty rare to just find and not have it spoil on the first hardships. And development is full of hardships.
1632,Because it was the target.  D&D got so much medi exposure by being the central target of the satanic panic (from the gaming side of it anyway) that it got enormous household recognition. Due in part to always being accused of being evil  anyone in the western world can tell you what D&D is  whether they have any exposure to it or not.  As a result  its become the default most people think of when they consider the game genre  the same way that you think of Hoover or Cellotape.
1633,"OP that's a 14 year old car that you bought in the rust belt. Assuming that it's spent at least a portion of its life in Pennsylvania  it honestly looks good for it's age. To me nothing there indicates flood damage. Signs of flood damage would be weird interior smells  electrical issues  large sediment deposits in weird places (in crevasses in the engine bay or in the interior behind panels where the dealer may not have cleaned)  or even visible water level lines (again in hard to see/reach places where the dealer would have missed cleaning it).  From personal experience working in a jiffy lube type place  some of the employees you find there think they know an awful lot about cars  but are actually just spewing BS. Saw one of my coworkers notice an oil leak coming from the front of the engine and tell the customer their rear main seal needs replacing.  Good news is that car is 100% drive able  and assuming it's mechanically fine  is honestly a decent deal for under 5 Gs.  Bad news is that even if the underside was immaculate  if you're living in PA and driving in the winter it will get very rusty eventually unless you keep the underside meticulously clean and/or get a nice oil coating  If you wanna feel better about driving it  check out /r/justrolledintotheshop try searching for ""frame"" or ""rust."" I'm a floridian so I've never seen anything crazy in person  but some of the stuff people are apparently dailying up north is astounding"
1634,I have done a software development internship as well as a data science internship at the same company. At the end of the DS internship  when we did our Demos  I realized how much cooler DS was. The projects that the DS team worked on were fascinating while software dev was significantly less so. I know this isn't true for all DS and software  but I really like cool DS problems.
1635,>Things like that never happen with anime made just to be an anime and not as a commercial for something else. Like you don't see many try to clone Fullmetal Alchemist or Cowboy Bebop's Space Noir or Ghost in the Shell or a contemporary competitor to Gundam's military hardware flavor of mecha. Or do they  I just haven't heard of them because they screwed up bad?  Multiples edgy magica girls show tried to be as successful as Madoka without success.
1636,The ps4 and 5 are just PC's in a Sony box so it's actually very easy. The same way because ps3 had those custom chips they will never be done unless Sony puts them phisically inside the ps5  bc the alternative was using an emulator and ps5 isn't powerfully enough to do it.
1637,Really  I'd recommend setting up a central data warehouse to get data out of all those silos  run extraction jobs on those spreadsheets where you can do validations and some sort of error correction (or at least notify if things don't match the schema).   It's still a silo but it's better than excel: I'd look into something like Power Apps if you're on o365 which I think gives a UI to edit the data in it's small database backend  assuming you can access that via obdc or something. There's a number of those low-code things out there. The best thing for this would be to set up some kind of front end for people to interact with even if it's just a form to submit data and get it out of excel where anyone can hose the data set and you can apply SOME level of validations or constrict the data types etc. I suggest that option because I'm assuming if you're asking how to keep excel or something like it  you don't have the budget or developers to build something better.  If you absolutely must just lock down an excel file  you can set columns to use drop downs that you specify the options for on a hidden sheet and do some other such minor stuff. I thiiiiink you can do data type enforcement too and lock down specific cells  but you'd have to Google. With that implementation  your options are limited and I would still be at least somewhat hesitant to trust that data.

1639,Fan manufacturers lie out their arses.  For starters  good luck getting a 120mm fan doing 1500 to stay below 30dB. Doesn't happen.  Airflow? Measured at zero restriction  not real usage.  Pressure? Measured at max restriction. Same problem as above.  Scythe makes good fans but expecting them to beat Noctua is more than a little optimistic.
1640,There still dex saves from other effects to consider  though. You can't half the damage of a fireball by raging. If you're group is ever trying to be stealthy  you're boned and theyre boned  unless someone's gonna always blow a spell slot for pass without trace.   Plus there are better feats that you could take as a barbarian than alert  like great weapon master  polearm master  sentinel  savage attacker  charger  tough  resilient  etc. I feel like taking a fairly niche feat to cover a self imposed weakness isn't the best move.   Plus  assuming you're using point buy and maxing at 15 + modifiers  there's no real need to gimp yourself so heavily. You should be able to max str and Con  give yourself a 13 in Wis and still have an 8 in dex  leaving you with nothing less than -1. Mind you that's not great  but it's waaaaay better than -4.
1641,Hi everyone. Thanks for helping! This is my first post here and I'm really looking forward to all the replies!   * **Location:** Chicago  Illinois  US  * **Price range:** $20k-30k (monthly lease payment should be less than $300 and down payment less than $4k.)  * **Lease or Buy:**  Lease  * **New or used:** New  * **Type of vehicle:**  Open to suggestions. I was mostly thinking sedan or SUV but if i can find a good sports/crossover/luxury in my price range than nice! No trucks.  * **Must haves:**No specific needs but i do like a nice interior. Also I'm into technology.  * **Desired transmission:** Any  * **Intended use:** Daily driver/weekend car  * **Vehicles you've already considered:**  Honda Civic  Kia K5  Honda Accord  Toyota Camry. Out of these  I'm leaning towards civic or accord.  * **Is this your 1st vehicle:** no  * **Do you need a Warranty:** not sure  * **Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:** Never done it before but I have lots of experience with engineering and machine work. I should be able to watch a couple of youtube videos and follow them.  * **Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:** probably not.  * **Additional Notes:** I want a car which I can drive around in the city or I can drive it to Wisconsin or indiana to visit friends. My top pick right now is accord/civic as they have a pretty decent interior and come loaded with features like auto start  heated seats etc.
1642,Keep it clean and happy. Might want to regularly clean out the cooling block as stuff can block this vent easily. If you are up to it repasting (thermal paste) every 3-4 years will also keep the heat moving from you components to the outside a bit better.
1643,When you say the paid ads were not worth it  can you elaborate on that? What was the click through? What was the cost per click? How much did you spend and how long was the ad live? And what sort of audience targeting did you do?

1645,I think it's better to design challenges in a way that using out of character information wouldn't ruin it. Basically  I assume if a player knows something and wants his/her character to know it  there's an in-world explanation for that and that's okay.  More than that  players and character knowledge is a resource you can use. The most things a character knows  the most subtle the hints they could pick up  and the most complicated challenge they can solve. So  if your players knows a lot about real-world survival  use that. Have them try to splint a broken leg on a semi-consenting half-ogre with minimal material. Or try to come up with creative ways to find food in the midst of winter.  And even if they have a clever idea  that doesn't mean they don't have to roll. It may be  but knowing the theory behind splinting a broken bone and doing it are two really different things.
1646,Could be pretty rare in that configuration. Look into GMs historical information and see if they have production numbers on there  that should be new enough that they do. Be aware  rare may not mean valuable in this case  though G bodies are probably still on the rise i expect.
1647,"> Kirk Ouimet: Does every cell have a wire that connects it to the pin? >  > Wise Being: In order to activate a specific cell  which can be thought of as pin number X  row Y  column Z  what you do is send electricity down the rows so that the electrons arrive to each cell. Then you send the correct combination of electricity and voltage down the columns to ensure that only pin number X goes into state 1. It is similar to a sliding puzzle in this way. It turns out that there are a lot of different combinations that will work for each puzzle  but only one correct combination of electricity and voltage in the correct sequence will produce the correct “image” of 1s and 0s (the actual data stored in the memory controller). > > Kirk Ouimet: I see — so the memory controller adjusts the voltage applied to the pin in order to read data. Is it just the voltage amount which is used? > > Wise Being: Voltage plays a role  but it is more complicated than that. There are actually separate voltage and current settings that can determine how much electricity of each type is allowed to cross the pin and thus flow through the cell.  This text here bothers me severely.  As many have pointed out: GPT-3 is a bullshit machine. It can spew bullshit  but if you know anything about the actual subject matter  it is obviously wrong. Note that ""Kirk Ouimet"" is the human author  ""conversing"" with Wise Being (the GPT-3 AI)"
1648,"Well  I would have changed majors. I was an engineering major  and looking back I would have switched to computer science.  Asides from that:  **Network with classmates more**: I had a small group of friends  and one thing I've learned is that who you know can open a whole range of doors. It's not going to walk you through the door  but it can be the difference between your resume getting a 5 second look from a recruiter vs. your resume getting a long  hard look by the hiring manager. It can be the difference between sifting through jobs on Indeed vs. getting put in touch with someone who is looking to post a job before they post it.   Some will say that your professional network matters more once you start working - which is somewhat true - but this isn't an either or. You can grow both networks.  If you don't want to truly network  i.e.  you don't want to build strong relationships with people  that's fine - but at least put a minimal amount of effort to make sure that you know people in your major and that they know you. That if you were to shoot them an email 5 years from now  they will recognize the name.  **Take classes that I didn't like:** I focused on taking classes in areas that I liked. What I should have done was take classes in areas that I needed but didn't like. I did not like stats in college. I did not like my one class in linear algebra  so i didn't take any more classes in either. By the time I got to grad school I had to do a bunch of remedial work on my own to catch up - and guess what  since I didn't like it  I was really bad at learning it on my own.  By contrast  stuff you like and are good at is stuff you can always learn on your own.  **Spend time becoming a more well-rounded professional**: I spent a lot of college and grad school focusing on learning technical stuff and getting good grades. I took pride in not caring about non-technical stuff and/or non-research stuff. It wasn't until late in grad school that I realized that I should have put more effort into broadening my skillset because that's actually my biggest asset - I wasn't the smartest guy in grad school  and I'm not the smartest data scientist. But what I am good at is everything else that a data scientist needs to be able to do.  **Develop better working habits**: It took years to undo the damage that college/grad school did to my work habit. In undergrad  I got used to being able to do everything last minute and still graduate with honors. In grad school I had to adapt a little bit  but I still had these really long deadlines that I would procrastinate on and get started way later than I needed to. Then I entered the workforce and I learned really quickly that my ""method"" didn't work at all. Getting stuff done consistently is the only way to survive  and I was not prepared for that."
1649,I don’t know  it could be preference to the language  it could be a weeaboo liking all things Japanese over all things English.  But as I prefer dubs and subs for different anime  I cant see any other animation or movie from America dubbed in Japanese. It’s like taking a language that has a lot of vocabulary in a sentence dubbed over language that usually doesn’t have a lot of vocabulary... at least from anime dubs they fill in the gaps. It just feels off
1650,Play whatever the hell you want - you really don’t need to become a subject matter expert before playing anything that might not be made from a purely white american/european perspective - you’d end up having very little to play.   Just don’t be a dick and play characters  not caricatures. Ezpz.
1651,I’ve been trying to get my company to take a more “Bezosian” approach to information: instead of using PowerPoints  write detailed memos or documentation. Have the stakeholders read the documentation prior to a meeting  and use the meeting time to discuss/for questions.   Taking it a step further  I like to use an auto-documentation tool like Sphinx. That way  when I’m building a report  I can keep iteration on the models and the documentation will automatically update (or using Jupyter and converting it into html/pdf). The documentation can be split into high level overview and a more technical (with code snippets) logical flow. Then for visualizations  just link to Tableau.   A lot of technical work seems too heavy to be disseminated into PowerPoint slides. I like the idea of writing a story/narrative  rather than using bullet points. It’s harder to understand Info on a PowerPoint and no one will read a long appendix. However  if you craft a narrative with good documentation  it’s easier to follow.   Does anyone else feel this way about PowerPoint? It’s difficult because in my experience  many execs are used to presentations. But it just doesn’t seem to go well with data science work. I’m frustrated with wasting my time formatting powerpoints and think documentation/Tableau are the way to go.
1652,Thank you for sharing your story. These practices need to be exposed. Those of us who work at large studios need to be more vocal in our demands to fight this (and actually I have seen a lot of progress in the environment of the studio I work at  which is nice). What's interesting to me about Ubisoft is that the people I know who work(ed) there mention how it's not uncommon to bounce around different projects at different stages in their life cycle and.... it seems Ubisoft has fairly consistent issues throughout these jumps. This means the problem comes from up high.
1653,If your company is cool with paying for AWS you should use that. But spinning up a bunch of VMs is probably going to hurt you if you're struggling with your current setup. Look into systems for reproducible builds. I like containers since lifting and shifting from dumb laptop to a compute cluster is trivial.   I would really caution against running company projects on private hardware  even if they say they are cool with it  because anything your work touches has the potential to be entered into discovery.
1654,If your players go out of their way to tell you they enjoyed the session  it seems you are a good GM allready. I know what impostor syndrome can do to one's selfesteem  but it seems you are doing great.   So just allow yourself to accept the praise you get. After all it's about everyone (that includes you!) to have a good time.   And if you are uncertain of the style or content of your sessions  just ask your players. Just reserve 15 miuntes at the end of a session and ask them what they liked or disliked  and what they want more or less of to have fun (i.e. more dungeon-crawling or social interactions or politics  more or less explicit lore etc.). It will help you focus your preparations  and you will also see what you are allready doing great.
1655,400 applications is not a lot cold applying. Cold applying you will be lucky to get one call back every 500 applications or so in this market. With easy apply should honestly be able to hit 400 applications in a week or so if that is your strategy (not recommended).   Instead you would be better to do networking at DS meetups or reach out to recruiters/hiring managers directly on LinkedIn. Also HackerNews Who's Hiring is useful for getting more direct contact info.
1656,"Personal assumption is its underclocked on non-""_macbook_"" platforms.  Then ARM-Macbooks will debute ""_The Brand New A14X_""  which will functionally be the same SoC but having a bigger battery & case to sink heat they can clock it higher.  That and they are running out of low hanging fruits. Benchmarks were showing the A12/A13 closing the gap to modern i5's and i7's  or even beating them. Which when your end perf is reaching those stages  you're super-scalar-out-of-order-voodoo gets pretty advanced and you get majorly into diminishing returns."
1657,Small question:  Data science isn't really my field  I know a tiny bit about ML but I don't know where to go from here. I have 3 variables  I want to predict a 4th. I have perfect and complete set of data (though it's small) to test any potential model on. The relationship between all 3 variables and the value I want to predict is: when all 3 get bigger  the 4th increases. The test data almost perfectly shows this. The relationship isn't necessarily a line  but looks more like an exponential curve.   Any advice on some (beginner friendly) methods I can look into?
1658,hi all! posting because I cannot for the life of me remember the name of a game which was kickstarted (I believe) a year or two ago.  the central conceit was that the players were the  old companions of a legendary hero  basically cycling through telling the stories of their adventures with the (now dead) hero and establishing facts about the world as they play. was fairly narrative  iirc.  i believe a main component was that the players filled in a map as they went  mapping out their travels &c.  does this ring a bell? am i imagining this game?
1659,I feel like this is Isekai with Smartphone (IoS)  but likeable. The similarities are there  such as a near-omnipotent MC who can apparently utilize all the magical elements  or a supporting cast extremely fond of said MC.  The reasons this works in the show:  MC is not a perverted douchebag whose only saving grace is his powers. Too often source writers think giving a character with no personality superpowers... equals a personality. Take for example  the douchebag in IoS. We know nothing about his past  just that he's a fellow psychopathically unaffected by his own death and so *meh* about the process of reincarnation that he asks God for a freaking smartphone on his new journey. We know more about the MC of this story--his background/the reason for his death--which speaks volumes of his general personality. He's not humblebragging. He's actually humble. He is fully aware that keeping it all to himself has led to his death  and even advises another that solving the problem with other people may be better.  The power he wields is understandable. The biggest *wtf* laugh I had in IoS was when the MC went up to the blind mother of one of his harem girls  said *heal*  and the woman could see again... Like  what is this Jesus Christ shit? Never mind that  the MC doesn't even reallyl acknowledge that it's a miracle in the works. If you're going to pull that off  at least be super confident like Anos Voldigoad: *Do you think your apparent lack of sight is going to stop me from giving your sight back?*   The sequence of events is understandable. In IoS  the guy spawns in the middle of nowhere and starts walking to the nearest town. On the way there  a fashion designer just happening to go the same direction sees his schoolboy uniform and pays him a king's ransom for this unique design (takes care of money issues). In the town  he just happens to see and save two girls harassed by some baddies. The girls naturally now want his babies  but more importantly  they are adventurers who can explain everything about the structure of this world and just happen to stay at the inn he's going to stay in... and that's how his legend starts. If Isekai with Smartphone was realistic  that douchebag would have nothing but his beloved smartphone and would have died from a dagger wound to his gut five minutes after walking that highway. On the other hand  aided by the tragic backstory of the MC and the fact that he mastered his craft over a span of three years  this story doesn't seem like a series of impossibly lucky breaks. His best skills are housekeeping and physical/mental pain tolerance  in that order. It would only make sense to me that his housekeeping skills are maxed out because he spent those three years honing them  while the other two are remnants of his previous life. His journey doesn't begin until the second episode  which is also appreciated.   And also the name. That smartphone was a freaking gimmick--MC used the titular device to search for ice cream rec
1660,On Scikit-learn’s load_digits dataset: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html  Does anyone know what is the best performance achieved so far on this dataset?   I tried googling around but can’t find examples with 100% score performance. I am thinking since this is a standard dataset  it would be easy to get a 100% score performance?
1661,Just because your character can do something epic  or physics breaking  doesent mean you should act on it. Let others have their moment  build on cooperative roleplaying with the other people around you.
1662,Although it’s not exactly data science (which is where I’d like to be down the road)  I got a job working from home yesterday as a technical operations analyst. I actually lost track of how many jobs I applied to but it has to be in the ballpark of 100. I had not one bit of relevant work experience coming out of university.  The reason I say that is because I’m in a medium sized Canadian city and have been searching for work since I finished school last January. I know the search can be exhausting and quite honestly put a damper on your confidence. Don’t give up! You’ll get a job eventually  COVID is making it extra difficult to find employment. Use this time to reflect on some skills you may need to work on  and try some new projects. At the end of the day you know your abilities and what you’re worth  it’s their loss for not taking you in.
1663,Entirely depends on you.  If you want a more straightforward plot  then no. Durarara!! is about how events intertwines the lives of its characters. If you want to experience character-driven narratives  then go for it.  It's one of my favorite shows  but it's not for everyone.
1664,So 2nd year coms student.   Doing statistics as a module  made a stats calculator in Jupyter Notebook and tbh  kinda love messing around with data and visualizing it.  I'm fluent-ish in Python. Should I continue my data science adventure in Python or try R for a bit?  It's not my goal to become a data scientist. It might be  might not. Just wanting to get my feet wet a bit.  EDIT:  I am not replying to all the comments but I did read each and every single one. Thank you guys so much for the info and advice :) I appreciate it a lot!  UPDATE:  So I watched a Python Data Science course and I am doing my first project. Still a bit hazy with everything. Slowly getting there though :)
1665,From what I've seen/read  the RTX 3080 is a great upgrade if you are coming from a Maxwell or Pascal GPU. If you already have a high end Turing card  whether it's worth it or not will depend on the resolution/framerate you desire.   The big downside is the power usage  luckily the RTX 3080 seems to benefit greatly from under-volting  [you can shave off 40W and only lose roughly 3% performance.](https://twitter.com/aschilling/status/1306309404824829955)  As someone with an LG C9 OLED (4K and HDMI 2.1) I definitely plan on getting Ampere (perhaps RDNA2 if it has it). I will wait and see how the RTX 3090 performs  whenever the embargo for that ends and decide between an aftermarket RTX 3080 or RTX 3090.
1666,Pretty excellent response from LG. These GPU's have only been available for less than two weeks and LG has already corrected the CX and BX bugs.  Apparently they're still working on the C9/B9 update.  The speed at which they're fixing these problems means that they'll likely be live long before most people even get their hands on an HDMI 2.1 GPU.
1667,As a Maeda fan I've been looking forward to this and the first episode did not disappoint. I like that it threw us right into the middle of things. And Sato's actress does a great job with the old-fashioned way of speaking. We even got to the obligatory Maeda baseball right away!  Angel Beats and Charolette also had great premieres. So it all really depends on how this show develops and ends. With the end of the world already being set up I hope this means Maeda came up with the ending to this story first and worked backward from there. Gonna be sticking around to see how it turns out!
1668,How long do MLCC capacitors last? Considering that Asus uses 60 MLCCs  should I worry about the longevity of my card? Can the MLCCs crack under normal use if the PCB is not flexed? How fast do they lose capacitance and can it make the card dead?  Sorry for the noob questions but I'm not an electrical engineer.

1670,"I don't know where you guys are but my local Canadian Tire's always been really straight-forward with me. The local mechanic quoted me the same amount as Canadian Tire  went over-budget ""uh  yea the part was more expensive than we thought"" and  while I didn't personally experience this  word on the street was that they regularly refurbish parts then claim them to be ""new"".  They're shady as fuck  and also only take cash. So... ya know. Just be aware."

1672,A portion of this is on you and the other players to set boundaries  which means you have to talk to each other out of character: “If he starts a fight that makes no sense  are we going to go along with that? If he wants to help a sketchy NPC  do we agree to help as well  or wait and see if there is another way?”  The main problem here is that he thinks he is the main character  and is expecting (and has been conditioned to believe) all the rest of you are his to command  no matter what he decides.  After setting and reinforcing that boundary  the DM needs to step up and grow a pair.  That looks like this: “hey man  the other players have decided their characters don’t want to go with you in that decision  are you going to continue alone and accept the consequences?” Obviously we are all expecting the man-baby to react badly  but it segues into the glaringly obvious confrontation: “You’re making this game less fun for the DM and the other players.  If you don’t want to play nice with the other players  you can’t play at this table.”  The rest of the “in-character” RP justifications are just chaff to distract from the real problem: you have a wangrod in the group.  Best of luck  hard to imagine the group continuing to exist with him in it.
1673,I'm going to have a tire alignment done on my car - they are charging $120 + tax  I've checked around and this price seems reasonable.  The problem is are there any other costs that are associated with an alignment? Do the tire technicians suggest additional fixing - eg  suspension components are worn - need fixing  stuff like that?
1674,"Hi! First post  I hope I get it right! I have read the rules.   Just want to let people know that the much anticipated **EJ Anime Museum** in the *Kadokawa Culture Museum* has set their **opening date as November 6th**. They will open with a ""**Newtype Anime Chronicle"" event to celebrate 35 years of Newtype**. It looks really cool  I hope to check it out. It runs until January 17th. No info yet on what comes after it.    [More detailed information in English about the exhibition.](https://insaitama.com/event/ej-anime-museum-kadcul/)    [Official website](https://kadcul.com/) (currently Japanese language only).     I see there have already been some posts about this  but the EJ Anime Hotel is also in the same location. It opened 10 days ago. The five anime currently featured in the hotel are:      * Bofuri: I don’t want to get hurt so I’ll max out my defense * Uzaki-chan wants to hang out * Konosuba: God’s blessing on this wonderful world * A certain scientific railgun * Yuki Yuna is a Hero  [Information in English.](https://insaitama.com/event/tokorozawa-sakura-town-ej-anime-hotel/)    [Official website](https://tokorozawa-sakuratown.jp/hotel/hotel.html) (Japanese language only).     All these are in Tokorozawa  Saitama which is about 30 minutes from Tokyo by car  a bit longer by public transport because of the way the train runs."
1675,Sigh. No offense  but there is some massive misinformation here.  You should **not** be going into neutral while in motion.  It reduces control and takes a hand away from the steering wheel for no good reason.   You should **not** feel compelled to drag the gearbox through gears as you slow.  It interrupts the driveline making braking and steering less predictable  and takes focus away from braking and steering at the most critical point in time (as you approach a hazard).   Brake *in gear*. When you reach a speed you will need acceleration from  move your foot to the accelerator and change down at that point. If  instead  you brake enough to bring the engine to idle  declutch. Go to neutral or 1st *after* you stop.  That’s all you need to do. Feed a little gas in as you make the shift down and that’s sufficient. Finish doing your braking *before* you change down  and that will “close the gap” between gears  making your shifts as easy as possible.  Watch driving lessons from places where everyone learns to drive on manual and gets professional help. The UK and Germany are good.
1676,Hey Guys  Is there any platform where I can watch and build a project for DS end-to-end on the same platform? I'm not talking about learning DS/Python from scratch  just some real-world projects on a cloud platform.  Would be great if this platform provides some cloud credits/machines too? Paid platforms are also fine for me  but is there any?  I'm asking because I feel I've hit a peak of learning stuff but need some projects to get hands-on experience. Kaggle is a close example as it provides a environment to practice also  but it's just exploring of data and training  no clarity on deployment.  Do you guys also face a similar problem?
1677,"Yup.  It was AD&D 2E that threw balance out the window as a concept because of their strict ""no playtesting"" policy  which created things like machine gun dart fighters and the inane kit concept.  It is important to understand though that just because Gygax included advice about balancing the game doesn't mean he in any way *succeeded* in doing so.  Gygaxian advice is interesting  and tends to take the form of whatever bullshit Gary Gygax happened to be thinking of at the moment (delivered in the most authoritative manner possible).  His posts on EN world suggest he mellowed a bit in his old age  but vintage 80s Gygax was out of touch with what D&D was pretty much from the moment he released the book  and the gap simply grew from there."
1678,The [Dark Skies contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/DarkWorlds/overview) was won by a purely Bayesian inference model. I was so impressed by a Bayesian [solution](https://web.archive.org/web/20140805003613/http://timsalimans.com/observing-dark-worlds/) winning that I dropped everything and studied Bayesian models for the next 3 days straight. Eventually I wrote a book on the topic of Bayesian methods and used the solution as an example.
1679,The course just present you an index of material to read. Even sometimes the index is not complete  you need to research on your own. Frankly speaking they are just ripping off money with free content that is available on the internet.   Please consider not enrolling the course and search on GitHub for the course. You will get all the contents. I myself regret spending all the money.
1680,Omg it’s happening! I knew this would happen! I always had the sneaking suspicion that the next gen consoles would be delayed until early next year because of the pandemic. That’s why they haven’t said the price or release date for either one! The companies know they may have to delay them till like March to meet demand.   They are both hiding behind an idea that they are waiting for the other to release the detail when they both know they may have to delay because the factories were shut down for a couple months and they won’t be ready for a worldwide release.   I really hope I’m wrong because i want spider-man come November!
1681,I would rank your likely bottlenecks as the following:  * **RAM (memory)**: Why? Dataset size that can live in memory. I would target 32-64 GB. But if you're buying from a vendor  I would just get whatever is cheapest and upgrade the RAM yourself. It's very easy  tons of Youtube tutorials on how to do so. Don't pay the vendor to upgrade your RAM  it's usually 2-3x the cost! * **SSD (disk / storage)**: If you want to work with multi-100 GB datasets  then having a bigger SSD can be nice. But if you're doing cloud for these larger datasets  then it's fine to have the disk you have * **GPU (graphics)**: Geospatial processing  deep learning  etc all are more GPU intensive.  * **CPU (compute)**: Multi-threading and multi-core is kinda pointless for most data tasks  most software doesn't know how to tap into it. Clock rate of 2.9 GhZ is fine but getting more CPU cache can speed up computation a little bit. But to be honest  I think very few jobs will involve CPU as as bottleneck.  I'll end by saying... **you can always upgrade your PC later!** In these COVID times  buy the PC that you can comfortably afford and you can always swap out & upgrade parts down the road.   I recently purchased this PC ([https://techbargains.com/deals/alienware-aurora-gaming-desktop](https://techbargains.com/deals/alienware-aurora-gaming-desktop)) because I wanted a good GPU. But I kept most of the parts on the cheap end  so I can actually max out the computer  run into the bottleneck  and then justify upgrading it as I hit the bottlenecks (instead of over-provisioning / over-optimizing from the get-go!).
1682,Worrying for MS given that every xbox so far has only really been competitive with PS sales in a few countries outside of the US. If their strongest market is losing that much share  they need to hope that the console does significantly better outside the anglosphere.
1683,After the first episode of the new season I was put off by the animation to a degree. Strong colour but a distinctly rougher style that I found to be more cartoonish. Then episode 2 hits and watching Rika dance at the festival showed some great direction and fantastic animation. I am drawn to watch more if this promise can be delivered upon  but I find the style in general to be a bit grating. What do you guys think?
1684,Depends on the cam  but usually the powerband is pushed up the RPM  and you'll find you'll need to ride a clutch a little more on 1st gear   and you'll find your engine will be more comfortable at a little higher rpm than before.   All in all   WELL worth it for the choppy  lopped  exhaust note
1685,ICRPG has a setting called... *Snow & Blood*? Maybe?  There also *is* a 5e setting called... something like *Star-Shaman of Planegea* and  honestly  it’s p fuckin’ cool if you’re not looking for ultra grit.
1686,"It's my first [\#ScreenshotSaturday](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/screenshotsaturday/)!   Not super new to GameDev  but I've recently commited to transitioning from a hobbyist to taking it seriously.    Here are some images from one of my projects: ""Evelyn's Quest""  a top-down open world that I'm making for my daughter. Procedurally generated levels! I love how the long shadows move as day transitions to night.

I just learned that it's happening for real! I'm so stoked!"
1687,Not sure what to make of the 768 GB/s bandwidth. It’s a significant step down from the 936 GB/s on the 3090  closer to the 760 GB/s of the 3080. Since Tensor cores are so bandwidth limited  I doubt this is a high-end quadro
1688,"The concept of ""Chuuni but with actual powers"" is really intriguing to me. At least that's how I interpreted it  ""Odin"" is really just a normal girl but she gained the powerd of omniscience and now uses it to live out her chuuni fantasies. Could be wrong though.  Nevertheless  really good first episode. Very intriguing premise and fun characters  plus a clear drive and end point: Just thirty days till the end of the world. This could very well end up being my favourite of the season."
1689,I tend to talk a little too much and not give my players enough of a pause to reply before I get going again. We play online with voice only  no video  so its harder to judge how long to keep quiet. But I wish I could rein it in!
1690,"Alternative suggestion:  Maybe ask him if he'd like you to try to run something for him? (and maybe 1-2 other carefully selected people).    To me  that is a way more thoughtful gift than ""Here  have a couple of books you could've bought on your own.""  It's also a lot harder  but if you feel up to it  I would offer."
1691,Wish I could make this a poll but for some reason that's illegal. I'm watching some popular shows I missed out on. Watching Steins Gate rn. Between Norigami  Black Butler  and Hellsing (Bones  A-1  or MAD) which should I watch next?

1693,Lots of answers here but I’ll try to distill it down to specifics 1. Practice allSQL query statements from Microsoft TSQL book 2. Practice pandas select  filter  group by  aggregates   lag  lead and other transformations. Try to repeat SQL exercises from above in pandas/numpy  3. Read “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow”. You can read the tensorflow section in deep if you have deep learning projects to showcase. Else  focus on really understanding non-deep learning concepts.  4. Focus on clearly explaining your projects 5. Python practice from hackerrank should be ideal

1695,I like the popsocket vent mount. You can also get the popsocket sticky mount if you don't want to block the vent  which is nice since it doesn't take up too much space when your phone isn't there.   Best part of the vent mount is you can take it out any time and it works on any car.
1696,Mine is avoiding the hellscape of scheduling altogether by deciding on a date and time and running a game no matter who shows up  instead of spending weeks going back and forth on an optimal time for everyone  you settle on a consistent time most people can make. I find this a more successful strategy in my anecdotal experience.
1697,My Pontiac Bonneville has a long reflector across the trunk. I thought I would be really cool if I was able to make it light up with led's or something. Do you guys think its actually possible or should I not bother trying?

1699,"I feel like this deserves its own thread rather than getting stuck in a current one as it's a recurrent topic and lie that keeps getting repeated.  It's normally something like ""older DnD didn't care about balance  here's why you should abandon it too"". Some kind of obvious lie like that.  This is a lie! Everyone who repeats it is lying! At home what you do with your player is your business  but old-school pre-2e DnD gave a shit about balance!  > ""player balance"" - The matching of challenges to characters with their abilities and the rewards  to provide an exciting game without making it too easy for players to succeed or too hard to survive  Is this some 4e fan advice? No! It's in the glossary of important concepts in the *Basic Rules* published in 1980!  >""Everything  is  balanced."" The DM should try to maintain the ""balance of play"".  The treasures should be balanced by the dangers. Some  groups  prefer  adventures  where  advancement  between levels is swift.  In such a case  since the treasures are generally greater  the  monsters should be ""tougher"". Other groups prefer adventures where character  development is more important  and advancement  is  slower.  If the monsters are too tough  and if the parties are  reduced by many deaths  then few characters will ever reach higher levels.   Damn  where's this from? The same book on page 60! These are 40 year old words!  What commentary does the Expert set have  in comparison to these 'Basic' rules?  >Encounters should be scaled to the strength of the party and should be in harmony with the theme of the adventure.  Page 59.  Maybe 1980 is too new. Would 1979 count? Here's Gygax's opinion back in *Keep on the Borderlands* when talking about adventure design.  >The DM is also the designer of the situations and must bear in mind the abilities of his or her players. **It is the job of the DM to see that the situations and characters balance**. If things are too difficult  the players will become discouraged  too easy and they will become bored. Is it possible for a good player to win  yet still be a challenge and a risk in doing so? Is the amount of treasure gained equal to the danger of trying to get it?  ---  **BALANCE IS GOOD**. It is the sign of a well-designed game and a well-designed adventure! The only game designers touting a lack of it are people that are *bad at game design*. Many - perhaps most  but it's impossible to get any kind or real survey about it - players enjoy DnD as a series of challenging but not too tough encounters! The feeling of 'flow' and appropriate tension is what entire fields of game design theory are based on and what people spend countless hours designing and tweaking in board games  video games and yes  of course  RPGs! To say that it's 'not important' is spitting in the face of countless people that work making the games we play.  The same goes for 'combat as sport' silliness. It's a vacuous argument. Why? Because let's say you are a GM interested in making an enc"
1700,The problem that I am facing right now is an old one but I didn't think much of it as I thought it was something to do with my headset but that theory was proven wrong as I have recently gotten a new headset. When I plugged my new headset in I still heard it. The problem is that even tho nothing is being played and everything is silent there is a static noise coming from somewhere even if I have the volume at 0 its still there. Also with my mic too when I talk there is also that static noise as well. Another this is that if I keep talking into my mic it just randomly cuts out and cuts back in again kinda like a pulse I am talking for 1 second and then the other second it cuts out and then  it cuts back in again the longer I talk as well the sound keeps going down too. It has nothing to do with my gear that I am using  as I tried it with a couple of them and the problem is still the same. The answer might be simple but I am a dumbass I tried to look it up on google but nothing I found help me.
1701,Google EZ-lip.  They make adhesive cut and stick lip/side skirt spoilers. They look pretty good if you line up the fitment correctly and can achieve the same general aesthetic as being stanced... with the added benefit that scraping will only damage your ~10$s worth of vinyl rather than a painted body panel.
1702,Hello everyone  I am a long-time lurker of the sub and just wanted to ask a question that has been on my mind for some time now. (TLDR at bottom)  &#x200B   Is going into a data science diploma program from a bootcamp like Brainstation the right decision?  &#x200B   My background is in business  I finished my **B. Comm in Supply Chain Management** this year and got interested in data science as my program had built-in 2 courses on data science. Learnt a lot about data mining  science  stuff like Bayes Theorem  kNN  etc despite not getting too much coding experience in it as we used analytics software. However  the whole concept of actually using the potential of big data to derive insights for companies  and optimize their operations got me really interested in a career in business-oriented data scientist. Also have a background in stats through my program.  &#x200B   My work experiences include my internship at a **Fortune500** healthcare supplies company  where I was tasked on doing data analysis on inventory and sales. At this point  I understood that Advanced Excel can only take you so far in data analytics. My other work-related experience was my capstone project with **Walmart Inc**. This involved performing a **data mining project** in regards to their eCommerce fulfillment (can't disclose much more due to NDA).  I really want to hone in on data science  and plan on using it in-tandem with my business knowledge to help firms learn and optimize their business processes. I have been searching through the sub  YouTube  Quoram and whatever source and experience I can find on the viability of a boot camp as a legitimate way to get into the field. I found that a good amount of people are **advising against data science boot camps** (and boot camps in general) as companies and Hiring Managers always prioritize candidates who have a degree in mathematics or CS  rather than a boot camp.  Would someone like me  who is really interested in a data science career and coming from a business background realistically be able to start a DS career from a boot camp?  Is the viability of  bootcamps really that bad? Or is this simply the case of comparing career prospects of students who have only done a degree in CS  engineering  math  etc. vs. someone who doesn't have a degree and only did a bootcamp? This was an impression I got from some of the articles and videos that I read up on. I totally understand a degree is more comprehensive  but will it fit my background as I already have a degree (albeit not in CS/eng/math) or will I need to get a degree in STEM as well?  &#x200B   Unfortunately  most of the master programs for the current year have already filled  and I will have to wait another year atleast to get enrolled into one of the masters program. I don't want to wait that long  and rather start a boot camp soon and get working experience as a DS sooner rather than being later. Waiting it out would put my career in an awkward position :/  &#x200B   Thi

1705,"if this is not the definition of a paper launch I don't know what is.  If they really had soooo many orders  they would just come out and say ""LOOK AT US  WE SOLD 10.000 RTX 3080's in just 30 seconds"" brag all over the internet  but the reality is ... ""we had like 30  and bots got them all in 1 second"""
1706,It depends on how technology develops.  There are some interesting nuclear-powered electricity generators in development now that turn ionizing radiation directly into electricity.  Such generators would take the place of batteries in electric cars.
1707,This is the first time I've ever heard this crazy theory. I remember the car mags at the saying that the entire RWD Regal platform was going away and being moved to a new FWD platform. Stuff like that doesn't happen quickly and just because it's faster than the Corvette. This is just a stupid conspiracy theory.
1708,Wow.. son giving a Ferrari to dad is awesome. I’m so envious of the position OP and his family have in this society to have such financial freedom.

1712,Hello all   My question:  Is working in Actuarial work and or analytics enough to get a data science job or do I need to go back for a Masters?  My current work situation:  I’m an actuary in health insurance.  I’m the most technical person in our Actuarial department and my boss oversees both the analytics and Actuarial departments.  We’ve talked about getting me in a leadership role In the analytics department.  In actuarial we do some similar stuff to the Analytics department so I don’t think the transition would be difficult  however I don’t think this department does much DS work beyond some simple linear regression in SAS.    My motivation for looking into DS:  I took a predictive analytics exam for my Actuarial Designation and really enjoyed it.  My favorite parts of my job are being able to create/automate tasks for predictive business insights through programming.  My least favorite part of my job is the Excel manual manipulation heavy aspects that come with being an actuary.  It’s hard to get away from because my peers only focus on Excel and don’t have knowledge of predictive analytic techniques so if I did work in Python it wouldn’t be “auditable”.  Other factors:  I’m pretty close to finishing paying off my student loans which is an amazing feeling  so I’d like to avoid taking on more unless it’s absolutely necessary.
1713,This is gonna me lame  but: you need to pretend that *YOUR CHARACTER* doesn’t see/hear/experience something that another player’s character does. If you’re not sure  ask.  I had difficulty learning that my first few games  but you get it soon.
1714,Cepheus Light. Sticks with the tried-and-true Traveller skill system formula but reduces the skill porn and simplifies some things. Rules-light at the table allowing for a focus on the narrative and mostly backwards compatible with Traveller products.
1715,I used SCP to get idea for my *Hunter: the Vigil* game I ran  so I'd suggest HtV or even blue-book *Chronicles of Darkness*.  CoD has rules for regular humans that get caught up in weird shit.  HtV is about people that have organized to push back against the monsters that lurk in the darkness. They're still humans  but have access to more tricks and sometimes even supernatural powers to fight back.
1716,"[Hearts of Wulin](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4eTCjb5VZ3v3bKl3XvwZkHgAj0NCMxX) has some brilliant combat mechanics. I especially like the PvP rules. When you challenge another PC you offer them any number of things if they let you win. These things can be narrative  such as ""you fall in love with me"". If the challenged rejects the offer  both PCs are essentially injured  and then they can make a counter-offer to win themselves  or call it a draw."
1717,And if you didn't think that used car dealers aren't already the scum of the earth... Many of them don't do the recall on cars in their possession even though they're supposed to before a sale.  It's not like the manufacturer and/or auction they pick up the affected vehicle from doesn't tell them when they register it for sale.
1718,For the Star Trek based game I started last fall  I told players that providing me a background was optional but would get them experience. I did suggest that if they did give me a background that it include how they knew one of the other characters. I haven't done that with the more recent additions to the game though.  I have also had one character be the employer/sponsor for the group as a whole when I have built a party of pre-gens.
1719,Microsoft has definitely gone to the Nintendo school of making their system names as unnecessarily confusing as possible.    I can’t imagine being mom/aunt/grandma going to the store to buy their kid an Xbox for Christmas and having some poor sap try to explain the difference between the Xbox One  One S  One X  Series S  and Series X.
1720,So I understand this is probably the 2nd most common question about driving manual but I just roasted the hell out of my clutch so I need a tailored understanding.  I’ve been driving a manual impreza for about 2 years now  I’m very very comfortable with it but still  to this day i get the occasional jerkiness when upshifting  but it’s barely noticeable. But my question today is downshifting and slowing down from a speed of about 50. I’m comfortable with rev matching to the point that my downshifting is smoother than my upshifting  but if I’m in 5th gear and need to get down to 10 pretty quickly  what I do is downshift into 4th with a rev match  then the rest of the way I just press the brake and cycle through 3rd then 2nd and into neutral to coast the rest of the way  and play with the clutch so it feels smoother. Now  the smell of burning clutch is a sign that tells me this method isn’t exactly correct. I can’t really imagine rev matching for each gear all the way down from 5th to 2nd is something commonly practiced outside of the track  so do I just go right into neutral and coast the rest of the way on the brakes?   Thanks  and rest in peace to my clutch
1721,Chinese games  or games released in China? Like would it require Sony or Microsoft to have people's real names as gamertags in China or something? Or would a Chinese game released here require our real name?  And what's the thought process/reasoning behind this? If there is one.
1722,Something that can be automated to a high degree but will never be able to function without the human in the loop: experimentation.  Anything that goes into production will need to be tested / benchmarked and this is and will continued to be the industry standard :)
1723,Only a fool would buy a new hardware before its been tested thoroughly by reviewers. That takes a few months. I don't feel sorry for all the 3080 owners right now. You knew the risks. Will you ever learn not to throw money at companies in the future is the question
1724,Depends on the company and your work. I worked as a manager and senior manager of analytics on my way to become director of analytics. I spend 50% on my own analytics  30% on mentoring and 20% on translating analytics to the business. I had employees with different backgrounds and managing/mentoring is great when your team is good. When you don’t have a great team  it’s horrible and will stress you out. I currently work a principal data scientist and probably climb the ladder as an individual contributor. If you have a good team and you do what you love it could be a great fit.

1726,You know  the i8 gets a lot of hate around here for being extremely expensive for the price  but wouldn't the same criticism apply to the polestar too? its $200k for 0-60 times in the 4.2 second range. it is also extremely heavy despite all the exotic materials use.   &#x200B   And unlike the i8 who is undoubtedly exotic looking  the Polestar looks pretty plain  and doesn't really have a special interior to back it up.  &#x200B   I almost feel like if the Polestar one was sold as a Volvo C40 T8 at like  $80k  people would laugh at it and call it a poor attempt......

1728,This is something that is a pretty plausible guess and something easy to fake. If it comes true then it would not be a shock to anyone and MILD gets to say he has special boy inside sources. If it doesn’t happen then you can handwave with “yields” or some other excuse.  Again  this is totally plausible and is something a ton of people have speculated on here  so it wouldn’t surprise me at all if they do a Titan or Quadro with these specs  but I just don’t trust this dude at all.

1730,It could just be the job. Maybe start looking for something that sounds like a better fit for you. You might do well at analyzing data that interests you. But you'd probably do better at building data things so look for a position that focuses on that.
1731,ECE Senior graduating May 2021  should I get a job now or wait till I have more experience in the spring?  TL DR: Right now I'm looking for employment summer 2021. I have 1.5 years of experience in software  data  and database engineering and 4 months of statistical analytics research experience. However because of the work and projects I'm doing this fall I'm going to be significantly more qualified to work with machine learning and predictive by the end of the semester  which is what I ultimately want to do. So my question to the experienced professionals of this subreddit is should I get a job now if I'm offered one  or do I wait till the spring to get a job or else insist that anyone who wants to hire me pay me for the experience I'm most likely going to have? (I don't even know if that last part is possible or reasonable.)  Post:  Hey everybody  I'm about 9 months out from graduating with a degree in Electrical Engineering focusing on Data Science & Information processing  so as a result I've been doing my best to get ready for the professional world by shifting my focus from classes to working and DS projects. However  something I'm struggling with is that while I currently have a nice nest-egg of experience to help me find a job by the end of this semester (if I really want to)  I also know that  I'll be a much more qualified candidate by the end of this Fall which might net me a higher salary or a job at a more well-known company. Let me explain my timeline a little so that y'all know what I'm working with now and what I'm going to be working with in the spring.  I started college August 2017  and that November I got a job driving students back their dorms/apartments. The system we used for organizing rides and drivers was really discontinuous and was basically just a mashup of google sheets and forms with Facebook messenger. After working there for a year  in summer and fall 2018 I decided to develop an Apache HTTP server web app front-ending a database which consolidated all the disparate services into one platform. I started a sole-proprietorship in my county and had multiple meetings with my bosses  their boss  and one of the vice-presidents of my universities parking and transportation departments in an effort to get them to purchase/use and promote the app so that I could sell it to other schools as a safety initiative. Surprise  surprise  they weren't interested in buying something which wouldn't make them any money without also boosting their PR  even if it would improve operational efficiency  so the project fell through.  However  the web app came through eventually and in Spring 2019 it got me a job working remotely part-time for an up-and-coming photonics startup in my area through an acquaintance I met in a student org. I was hired as a database engineering intern  although I was essentially self-managing as I worked largely on my own with some direction from my boss to develop a database frontend they could use to track  sto
1732,While I do permanently maim/kill my player characters  it isn’t ever a surprsise rule. You may die. You may become God Emperor of the land.  they can fuck off with “oh i just read your feature  get dunked on” though
1733,To balance the optimism in this thread -  I had a trainee who was absolutely horrible. I would have to correct her stuff every goddamn day. I'm talking about easy reports she sends daily. She just didn't pay attention. Some people are perfectionists and obsess about smallest details. And some people don't care at all  they live in constant chaos. It's not something you can fix - you can improve it certainly  but you'll always be disadvantaged vs conscientious people who pay attention to everything and double-check in an almost paranoid way.  To contrast this  once she left  I got a new trainee and I think in half a year I didn't correct him once. He got hired full time and was amazing  More about the first girl - she actually told me she got diagnosed with some mental issues - strong social anxiety etc. No doubt that was part of why she couldn't focus on her stuff. But that is no excuse and the objective fact is that she was the worst trainee I ever head. I couldn't trust her with the simplest analysis  everything had to be double-checked - EVERYTHING. That is not a person you want as an analyst. If we work with so many numbers  I cannot double check every single thing  every single formula in Excel etc  I might as well just do it on my own. She didn't improve at all after half a year  it was a personality based problem.
1734,Is it just me or there are many subtle differences between the rendered picture on Twitter vs the model in Fortnite? The heatsink exhaust is a lot less blocked off by the Radeon logo in the Fortnite model  and the exhaust vents aren't blocked above the PCIE power plugs there either.
1735,I enjoyed learning about decision theory a lot.  It’s basically a general paradigm of how different statistical procedures work and what they are relatively good for.   This is a good introductory course that doesn’t go too deep in the mathematical side of things  but many results mentioned require analysis to prove:  https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/stats300a/
1736,Call of Cthulhu can work for the right game.  It has a nice Sanity mechanic  as long as you wanna focus on the things man should not know.  I could see Deadlands for this time period as well.  Take out the spaghetti western and it makes a pretty good horror game.  And of course any of the every-systems.  GURPS  FATE  etc.
1737,I come across this often in the field with models used to estimate manufacturing measurements.   This common story happens.  We get a good result using cross validation.  Then deploy it and it works for a certain time.  For my work the models drift away quickly within days or weeks because the underlying system is degrading  people keep modifying the system  and also we can’t measure everything for input data.   The less work that is done in the model exploration and simplification to avoid overfitting  the faster this model drift happens.   We have adaptive models and automatic updating  but that still doesn’t work well if you keep having to adapt since your overfitted model drifts each new inference...     So the approach you describe ends up using more resources and everyone will find out eventually .   They will have to be shown how robust it is after deployed.  Maybe your system is super stable and stationary so modeling is just plug and play...   nothing of value is like that however.   If you have a large historical dataset   try to train and test on the oldest data in time  and leave out a lot of data for simulation/validating to show robustness. Just like it’s deployed.
1738,"Computer engineer here that doesn't remember a single thing about power electronics because I went into firmware - agree with mostly everything.  It's tiring hearing armchair engineers without a degree pointing to things they themselves don't know about. When you have engineers saying ""we don't know"" it's because that's true. To properly debug this  you would need to spend time in the lab with a lot of equipment."
1739,Hi everyone! I have developed an educative game called “Logic Gates” which aims to teach logic and logic gates in a fun and interactive way. Everybody can understand and complete the educational levels in which you learn the basics of logic and experience with logic gates in an interactive simulator. After learning the basics  you can solve the puzzles which are more challenging problems. If you are already familiar with logic  you can directly try to solve puzzles. Also  there is a sandbox mod in game where you can create your own logic circuits and gates.  If you are interested in mathematics or computer science  you should **definitely** play the game because logic is the most fundamental topic of those areas. Here are the links:    [https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/mantik-kapilari/id1533790336?l=tr](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/mantik-kapilari/id1533790336?l=tr)    [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeremOner.LogicGame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeremOner.LogicGame)  I would be glad if I can receive some feedbacks from you.

1742,I'm looking to update the firmware of electronic devices that are rather old. I googled its respective oem website & updates are available but the requirements are to be using old version of windows (not 7 or 10). I believe it needs the older drivers to update.  How can one go about doing such update if one only has access to a windows 7 or 10 laptop?   Apologies  not sure if this is the right thread. If not can someone recommend the correct one.   Thanks
1743,I would say that Google Colab would provide you a lot of functionality for free depending on your work. Unless you need to run something locally  that might be a better option. With that being said  I think your specs are probably enough.   If you need more computational power  you can pay for more in Colab for a fraction of the hardware cost of a MacBook. In fact  I still use a 2012 MacBook Pro as my personal computer and any memory intensive tasks I just run on Colab. I made it through DL related tasks in grad school the same way.
1744,Im fairly new to the ttrpg world but with the help of certain podcasts and a few games i have fallen in love with dnd   but   im looking to branch out . What is in your opinion a game somewhat simmilar to dnd regarding the rpg   combat    and roleplay aspects that is objectively better ??
1745,"Real talk: this is not the time to move jobs while throwing caution to the wind. If you have a good  stable job  stay put until this thing settles down OR if you are able to land an actual good  stable job where you want to live.  It's going to be hard to get a good job (not coolest  just good) for the foreseeable future because  due to COVID  demand is far lower than supply. This is more true the lower on the experience-level you go.  My advice would be to calm down  and not look at this as a ""we need to get back to NYC or Boston asap"". Unless there is a true emergency-type reason to do so (dying family member  extreme mental anguish from quarantine that could be made better by being closer to family  etc.)  take a deep breath  realize that you will be able to find a job you'll be excited about in NYC or Boston if you give it some time  and start from there.  I would say that even in non-COVID times  you probably want to give yourself 6 months to a full year if you're doing a job search that requires you to move. Anything less than that  and you will be making a rash move that will make you leave money and/or job satisfaction on the table."
1746,It’s my least favorite system by far. The rules don’t favor storytelling which is what I want out of a rpg. If I want tactical combat I head to board games or warhammer. DND is too combat heavy for my tastes.
1747,That's not really a spoiler. Honestly even if you know most of the story of One Piece it wouldn't really spoil much of the enjoyment as it mostly comes from the feeling of adventure and individual scenes rather than overall story.
1748,My games are short on description. I describe how people behave  how they show emotions. I describe cinematic things someone does and things that happen to them. But as soon as an interesting conversation or action starts  I ignore the environment that's not directly relevant. I've been told several times that adding just a few sentences at the start of every scene to let players know how places look  sound  smell and feel would be helpful and I try to do it  but still often forget.   It's something I intentionally trained myself into  because I know from my own experience how tiring it is when the GM goes into long monologues. But I have gone too far and need to partially reverse it.  &#x200B   Another problem is that I like games with interesting mechanics  but in play I forget about the interesting parts I wanted to use. I don't have this problem as a player  but as a GM  with a lot of things I have to track mentally  I often ignore things that would be useful. Sometimes it's an NPC not using a cool ability or combo in a fight and getting beaten easily. Sometimes it's about a specific subsystem that could be engaged  but I use the basic resolution instead.   It's not about me intentionally ignoring parts of mechanics. I want to use them  that's why I run the games I do. But they just sometimes slip my mind when I need them.
1749,"That was good and fun holy shit  it's so quirky I love it. I was for sure not expecting something like that  I was expecting some serious sports drama but this is even better.   Damn  seeing that the mom has passed made me sad. Rei is awesome  what a bundle of sunshine and Leonardo is hilarious.   Ora ora Jotaro is also a great MC  ""I will retire not"" ""Eh?""  And finally that OP was wacky as fuck  it's amazing. Well  let's see where this show goes so far it's really interesting."
1750,Definitely [Lotus Europa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Europa).  It has a front end that is not too atypical for a sportscar of it's vintage yet at the same time the rear looks like someone forgot to design it. The rear is just a box!
1751,"Skyfarer  after the videogame of Sunless Skies by Failbetter.  I've really enjoyed their games  the setting  the premise  the setting  the writing  the setting  it's all pretty good. Especially the setting.  But it's a bit rules light for me. I like a little crunch to make characters more distinct  and honestly as a new DM something a bit more set in stone is a helpful handrail. I'm not quite sure how well the ""you're all officers on a vessel"" thing works... If it's too constricting  or a little routine  idk  and again what we have is fairly light so I can't fall back on it much to keep the party interested.   I can't complain  it's free  made in their spare time I'd guess when not working on the games  but I want to try and make something work there. Hopefully this Worlds Without Number coming up can give me a good framework  or at least foundation  to come up with something."
1752,Its all on the person  some dealerships are really good about it. Porsche and BMW (NOT NA) are good about it.  GoAuto on the other hand is a horror story. Charging 2 diagnosis fees on 2 fuses in the same box that would of been picked up at the same time.   $20 in parts  2 fuses but cost $500 for diagnosis.  $100 brake job that costs almost $1000 because they want to resurface the rotors.  I won't go to dealerships ever again besides to get my free oil change but I still do my own every month just to make sure they're doing it.  And some ma and pa shops don't anything  say the other mechanics fucked up and they fixed all of it for cheap. Only for something worse to happen.  Its all about finding the right people
1753,SoftBank is set to sell the UK’s Arm Holdings to US chip company Nvidia for more than $40bn  just four years after its founder Masayoshi Son bought the chip designer and said it would be the linchpin for the future of the Japanese technology group.   Multiple people with direct knowledge of the matter said a cash-and-stock takeover of Arm by Nvidia may be announced as soon as Monday  and that SoftBank will become the largest shareholder in the US chip company.   The announcement of the deal hinged on SoftBank ending a messy dispute between Arm and the head of its China joint venture  Allen Wu  who earlier rebuffed an attempt to remove him and claimed legal control of the unit.   Several people close to SoftBank said the matter was now “resolved”  though one person close to Mr Wu said he “remains the chairman of Arm China”. A spokesperson for Mr Wu declined to comment.   The takeover values Arm above the $32bn price that SoftBank paid for the business in 2016  a deal that was struck weeks after the UK voted to leave the European Union and prompted critics including Arm’s founder to accuse the country of selling off the crown jewel of its tech sector.  While Nvidia is paying more for the asset than SoftBank did  the price also reflects the scale of Arm’s underperformance under the Japanese group’s ownership.  Nvidia had a market valuation of roughly similar to that of Arm’s at the time of the 2016 deal  but now trades with a market value of $300bn  or roughly 10 times the amount SoftBank paid in cash for Arm. By paying for a large portion of the deals with its own shares  it is also passing part of the risk of the transaction to SoftBank.  For Nvidia  which recently overtook Intel to become the world’s most valuable chipmaker  the deal will further consolidate the US company’s position at the centre of the semiconductor industry. The British chip designer’s technology is starting to find broader applications beyond mobile devices  in data centres and personal computers including Apple’s Macs.   Arm would transform Nvidia’s product line-up  which until now has largely focused on the high end of the chips market. Its powerful graphics processors — which are designed to handle focused  data-intensive tasks — are typically sold to PC gamers  scientific researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and self-driving cars  as well as cryptocurrency miners.  To pave the way for the deal  SoftBank reversed an earlier decision to strip out an internet-of-things business from Arm and transfer it to a new company under its control. That would have stripped Arm of what was meant to be the high-growth engine that would power it into a 5G-connected future. One person said that SoftBank made the decision because it would have put it in conflict with commitments made to the U.K. over Arm  which were agreed at the time of the 2016 deal to appease the government.   SoftBank's Vision Fund previously held a stake in Nvidia  in a rare publicly listed investment 
1754,&#x200B   I recently have been seeing white flickering pixels pop up on my monitor usually most visible in dark areas of the screen and I already have tried a new HDMI cable and that didn't fix the problem so I tried it on a different monitor but the issue still occurs. I did get a new graphics card a month ago but it hasn't started flickering until a few days ago. Does anyone have an idea on what's going on here?
1755,If you can wait like a month or two  the RTX 3070 will be much much better than the 2070. Hardest part will just be getting your hands on one since they'll likely sell out within 5 seconds of launch (not exaggerating). But supply will come back and it will be worth it.   Also you didn't list your RAM speed. To oversimplify  Ryzen benefits from faster RAM. I recommend a 3200 MHz or 3600 MHz kit. Also Ryzen is still a little picky when it comes to RAM  so check that it's on the motherboard's QVL.
1756,The prinnys have been talkative on switch news for some time now. Looking forward to new disgaea
1757,Plans shift as the game goes on. Support for the project within the company waxes and wanes. They'll start building a game with an idea  then realize that either it's unworkable  or that with a little more effort they could make something that people think is even cooler. As this happens  some revolutionary new game engine comes out. You know that if you release on the current engine next year  people will criticize the game for missing features  so the project switches engines. And of course  you'll need to remaster all the textures to take advantage of the higher resolutions that the engine supports  create new textures for some new mapping type  etc.  It's hard to perfectly plan and execute a project  and each imperfection can mean years added to re-working assets  pivoting to a new idea  etc.
1758,Non-model idea: if you use sql  and you have document numbers attached to each item  you can get the percentage of occurrence of an item with another item. I had to do this last year. Though the market basket analysis sounds like a noggin scratcher  will give it a check tomorrow to see what I can get.   The issue I ran into with that sql query is that putting it together is kind of a process. You could do it for the top 100 items (based on your prerogative  but anything beyond that turns into a huge hassle.

1768,"My biggest flaw are interesting descriptions.   Now  my players say I do a great job describing things  but I know they're lying because:   1. We have trouble when we try encounters using Theater of the Mind 2. My players are too nice 3. I have really cool (in my mind  at least) environments  but when we're in the session  it comes out as  ""There's a large man-of-war in the harbor. It's super big  lots of cannons.""   I've been practicing writing out descriptions in my notes  but when I'm at the table  reading directly from my notes feels *fake*  and if I try and improv it  it comes out as...uninteresting.  My last bit of practice comes from reading more  and saying those descriptive moments out loud  as though I'm saying it to a group. The hope is that the more I read and practice it this way  the better I'll be at clear improv."
1769,Don't miss the trees for the forest. One path leads to a forest with many stumps. I'm going to say it again: Zen 2 is not the choice for gaming focus builds in the current cpu market. Only if you have to choose the most budget-est build does it ever look attractive thanks to the existence of very cheap motherboards that allows ram overclocking.
1770,"Recently I saw a message from an indie developer who shared his progress  he is making a game like Stardew valley. The first comment was like ""dude  your game is very similar to Stardew valley  the game needs a zest"" and I wondered why there must be a zest for an indie game  what's wrong with someone make a clone of another game?   If you look at the games of large companies  this is one big clone  battlefield  assassin creed and everything else. I don’t remember at all when large companies issued something really new? Yes  there is cyberpunk  and star wars  but in fact these are just clones with different graphics.   If you look at the film industry  everything has died there long ago  action films in the style of a tough nut  where the main character is a goof 90% of the time  and then finally saves the whole world or a flock of superheroes  blue  red  iron  fast  strong. What I mean is that the world has long entered the phase when we watch a film  not because this is something new that I have not yet seen  but simply because I need.   It's the same in the gaming industry  it is impossible to always create something new  so there is no need to complain that such a game already exists. What do you think about this?"

1774,I can't imagine a laptop 3080 using the same Samsung 8nm silicon. I don't know how well it'll scale down  but I do know that the Quadro RTX 6000 was the largest/hungriest desktop GPU ever crammed into a laptop.   295W (desktop) -> 200W (mobile)  It might be possible that Nvidia could use the (unconfirmed rumored) more efficient Quadro chips (TSMC 7nm) to make the mobile 3080. That might make the power requirements and heat management more palatable  if only more expensive.
1775,C++ is the main language for Game Development and hard to learn.   C# is easier to learn  as far as i know Unity and Cryengine has C# scripting language support.  if you want to do Game development professionally i would suggest you to start with C++ otherwise C# would be a good option to go.    For the tutorials Youtube is full with them. There are bunch of courses on Udemy also but they are mostly focused on one specific game engine (C++ Unreal  C# Unity)
1776,I am working in the Pharma analytics field and want to move from conventional analytics to more deeper and technical intensive field. There are a number of options to pursue from data science  AI  ML etc. Can you comment on what should be best to pursue?
1777,Honestly dude...  if you're gonna sniff gas  please don't do it right before driving.  It's only a matter of time before you hurt yourself or someone else.  At this point it sounds like an addiction.  I'd seek help.
1778,Open world Action RPG what is this  2015? Does anybody still enjoy filling out skill trees  finding 100 collectible flowers  and searching for the 6 pieces of the end game gear you wear for 1 screenshot?
1779,You need to tackle bigger problems.  If a python or R script alone was all it took to solve the problem you are facing  you are selling yourself short and not thinking big enough.  Can you make a web front end that handles the input/output to your backend script? Have you tested how big your input can be before your script crashes? Can you use a rest api to get some of the input data rather than asking the user for it? Can you setup a system to look up values just-in-time rather than hard coding them into the script?   Just some examples without knowing anything about your background. Every tool has a purpose  and if you aren’t using them it’s because either the tool is bad or you just havent worked on the kinda of problems where it comes in handy.
1780,100% this! My gf took her car to the VW dealership because a headlight and plate lights were out. They charged 25 bucks a piece to “fix” plus labor. They then said the new headlight bulb didn’t work so there is likely some other electrical issue and to schedule an appointment for that. I took it to our local shop and they found that the dealership mechanic used the wrong bulb and that’s why it didn’t work. So not just because local shops are cheaper  but also just better all around lol
1781,"Hey there- maybe check out the AI app marketplace [Gravity-ai](https://www.gravity-ai.com/home). Living the data science dream can be a real drag and draining.  I totally get it  especially when you are trying to boost your skills and gain exposure.  Here's a quote from a blog I just read.   **New opportunities for procurement professionals**  As a result of these added efficiencies  McKinsey predicts that B2B marketplaces will enable procurement teams to dedicate their time to more important tasks in the future.  “Marketplaces free up procurement teams to place more focus on value-adding activities  such as strategic purchase categories  innovation  and sustainability ” write the authors of the report. “With less time spent vetting vendors  chasing down transactions  coping with paperwork  reining in rogue spend  and ensuring compliance  procurement teams will be able to devote more of their energies to higher-value work  such as researching new and better materials  and unearthing promising marketplaces.”   ""   [https://blog.gravity-ai.com/ExpertsAgreeOnlineB2BMarketplacesaretheFuture](https://blog.gravity-ai.com/ExpertsAgreeOnlineB2BMarketplacesaretheFuture)"
1782,>*is too in depth whereby you’ll need programming languages to get data*  What is necessary depends on the needs of your employer.  However  learning basic data retrieval and cleaning skills (some combination of R/Python/SQL) is a huge differentiator between you and the average marketer.  Valuable to pursue  IMHO.  In my case  as a junior  it allowed me to work independently on ideas and projects without needing to bring another employee in to help.
1783,Oh no children won't be able to gamble in video games as much anymore. And shame on Epic for being so tone deaf they think this is somehow equivalent to fascism and trying to call their fans to arms like there's going to be marches in the streets. The US and UK are teetering on the brink of going full-blown fascist  but yeah let's focus on a money-fight between two megacorps with budgets larger than some countries. #BanFortnite #LetThemFight #NoOneCares
1784,The title really says it all haha but yeah I’m searching for horror/thriller and/or psychological anime. I’m totally fine with lots of gore and all that jazz. I’m kind of looking for something similar to Tomie (if anyone’s seen/read that) if that helps. Thanks!
1785,*Xas Irkalla*. I think it is described as anticosmic chaos-gnosticism  the game. It is largely based off of the music of Dissection. The core book isn't grimoire by itself  but I did find a bit of insight worked in there. Fantastic art.  Less a game and more a prop is *The Frost Papers.* Though honestly that one is just kind of a short guide to some ritual magic.
1786,A lot of the Resident Evil 4 stuff with Ashley works well. It required you to protect her and make decisions about how best to do that with a reasonably forgiving fail state (being carried off rather than just hit and die).
1787,**Hello everyone!**   Where do I begin? I missed a lot of the thread’s popularity by being late  but I had to really get into the perfect mood to watch the episode. So here I am…118 screenshots later at 7:30 AM doing a write-up. I love GochiUsa a ton  it is incredibly precious to me and is the series nearest and dearest to my heart. When I first got word S3 was announced  it really felt like a dream come true. Oddly enough  I am also pretty much an anime-only viewer (well  I read the manga up until the end of S2 and will read the rest after S3 concludes)  so this was ALL new content for me. I hadn’t look up any of the promotional teasers or even the OP/ED previews. Anyway  enough about me…Lets just get into it!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  With a new studio taking charge of the series  I was a bit nervous  but they seemed to knock it out of the park. I think the style looks perfect and I’d argue that the [backgrounds](https://i.imgur.com/DOnQyBX.png) have even more detail than before!   Ah…It certainly has been [quite a while since I’d last visited](https://i.imgur.com/tVoLNE2.png).  [Seeing my girls again](https://i.imgur.com/QQhCPzf.png)…I’m too happy…This was quite a fun gag to begin the episode with!  [This episode title!](https://i.imgur.com/grKOvuI.png) It’s definitely a reference to the character song of the same name! It’s one of my favorites from the series (which includes 200+ songs that are all incredible *cough cough stream GochiUsa music on Spotify*)  That chilled coffee has certainly got our girls [looking pretty cool](https://i.imgur.com/sJuxMcV.png) B) I also love that they started the episode with the Rabbit House crew wearing different hairstyles than their usual. Ponytail and Sidetail Cocoa is Justice!  [A very cute Cocoa](https://i.imgur.com/pEoTb90.png). Rize teasing her with the iced drink was adorable.   [Piggy piggy back!](https://i.imgur.com/zFOP2V6.png) This was a fun gag and I was not expecting Chino to jump on board at all lol  [Syaro mabushii](https://i.imgur.com/LKobNjW.png)…Glad they brought the characters together as early as they did  and had the opportunity to show off what Syaro’s skill as an adept bargain hunter.  I would have loved to see Cocoa in a sequin uniform  _  [The animation here looked really nice!](https://i.imgur.com/A9xbvT6.png)   We get a throw back to Chino’s [“unique” artstyle](https://i.imgur.com/v4tkCVU.png) as well as Cocoa’s “[Onee-chan ni makasenasai!](https://i.imgur.com/UEq3ORY.png)” and “[Welcome come on!](https://i.imgur.com/Lt1kQDT.png)”. Even though its a CGDCT series  GochiUsa has a ton of terrific running gags!  I’ve been really hoping [they’d work it into the show](https://i.imgur.com/S74dD6Z.png) and now it seems like the [Phantom Thief Lapin](https://i.imgur.com/GrtjSKn.png) is pretty much confirmed to be anime canon!! I’m SO EXCITED! They even threw in one of the Phantom Thief Lapin [famous lines](https://i.imgur.com/Xh3qO9E.png)! I look forward to seeing how it’ll be presented to us (I w

1789,Powerpoint style presentations (as opposed to the tool) are totally fine done properly. So many people just don't seem to give a shit about actually putting any effort in and loads of technical people put way too much detail in. 90% of people just need the tl dr not lengthy prose or code snippets.  Documents are probably the lowest bandwidth highest cost method of communication there is. Bezos probably gets away with it because people will get fired if they don't read all this stuff.

1791,Does this mean existing GT350's will go up in price over the next 5-10 years? (or hold their value well)  I've seen speculation of a Mach 1  but that'll be the last of it. Not to mention the new mustang is already an EV.
1792,As someone that also lives in Toledo  none of those will draw attention. Iv seen probably 3 i8’s  3 F-types  and countless Corvettes. In Perrysburg Iv even seen an Aventador. Plenty of WAY nicer cars. None of the ones you are considering will draw much attention. They are nice but not in your face nice around here. Plus most people love their American made in Toledo. A new corvette or Shelby GT would pull 10x more attention than an i8 around here.
1793,I found this channel recently. Covers a few different topics  mostly engine builds  but some other car mods as well. Content is interesting and explained really well.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClrxhTmxy5KCT0_Z_imvwcQ
1794,2007 Toyota RAV4 Limited  Purchased used in August 2012 with only 25k miles on it. Currently 119699 miles. Has only needed standard maintenance  no repairs beyond replacing brake pads a few extra times maybe. Been paid off for several years. I really like this car and it has served me well when I started as a single woman to now married with a toddler. Plenty of cargo room and room for a second car seat (we are trying for a second child) my husband has a 2015 Jeep and it’s fine but I don’t really like the touch screen and increased tech of newer cars.   So I guess my question is how long can I drive my RAV4 and what determines how long a car will last? I commute only 10-15 minutes to work 3-4 days per week (though that may change to 45 min each way next year) and that’s about it besides errands around town.
1795,Has anyone heard of Institute of Data from Australia?   I am looking at some data science bootcamp and I came across this training provider  Institute of Data. Anyone heard of it and can give any reviews?
1796,"Vampires are immortals with a strong resistance to conventional firearms and have wonderous powers. Werewolves (if you can slog through it's mind numbing preachy lore) are furry captain planet esk Superheroes. Mages alter reality (these guys don't really fit in a game world based on classic monster archytypes). These creatures are redonkulous and tend to fear less since the're already pretty high up on the food chain. Best way to run a horror game is to remind players they are indeed human. With that said  I ran one VTM game after finishing my classes on Organized Crime. So I ran a OWOD that ran closer to a Super Natural Mobster game. It was a lot of fun  especially when the players began whacking the Camirilla  the Sabbat  The Giovanni  and anyone else who looked even vaguely like a threat to their new found power. They were definately not idealistic Anarchs either  they were ruthless upstart crime bosses trying to build an empire. After killing off the local Los Zettas  Ayran Brotherhood  Giovanni  then purging the Sabbat  whacking a few Camirrilla elders  it began to dawn on them that a mob war was a recipocal contact sport. When one of my players asked me ""Are we gonna make it out of this?"" And I just shrugged.   If you want to do a no bullshit horror game with OWOD  have everyone write up normal humans  not Imbued  psychic  or even holy hunters  just regular Joe's. No powers or anything that makes them inhuman. Dump the entire lore as you will not need to refference it (that  and lets be honest  some of OWOD lore got a little cringey  looking at you WTA!). The less players know  the better. Having preconceptions about Vampire clans  Werewolf tribes  Wraith Guilds  etc. and pulling that rug out from underneath them? Great way to maybe spook them. Last but not least do not pull punches. You don't have to be an absolute sadist or make something like a PC death quota but the occasional PC death can definately raise those stakes (pun intended!). For horror I enjoy throwing things at them that are not in the WOD darkness books. There are thousands of cryptids or creatures from myth that can work with this."
1797,Damn that was a really fantastic first episode  definitely among the best this season. Hanae Natsuki really voiced 2 P.A. Works MC in a row. And Ayane Sakura voicing Hina? Good shit.   Overall that was a really funny episode  feel bad for Yota. He got rejected in the first episode lmao. Haven't watched Angel Beats or Charlotte but  I know they were kinda rushed hopefully this doesn't end with the same fate. Because  this is fantastic so far.
1798,* Half Life 2 - Alyx is useful and a bullet sponge. * Enslaved: Odyssey to the West - the game is built around Trip and she doesn't endanger herself. * The [Fetching Females](https://deadrising.fandom.com/wiki/Fetching_Females) mission in Dead Rising 2 - it's a twist where >!the women you're supposed to escort are a security team and they do an awesome job wiping out zombies!<. I was sad when I dropped them off at the Safe House.  See also [similar old thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/4yd6y3/have_you_ever_experienced_a_good_escort_mission/).  This is another standout:  > I remember a part in Metro 2033 where you have to escort a child to the nearest settlement in the underground. Rather than follow him  or him following you  he jumps on your back  calls out when he sees monsters  and makes you more inaccurate in your shooting  given that you have a child on your back.
1799,Hi   I hope everyone and their families are staying safe.  I'm currently a senior about to graduate with a degree in economics and a minor in data analytics at my undergraduate. I want to become a data scientist but I don't think I have what it takes as of now. I also need a job as I graduate so I'm trying to get an entry level data analyst role first and transition into a data scientist role in the near future. I would love to attend graduate school but it isn't a feasible option for me now.  At school I've learned the foundations of statistics  python  database management systems  and SQL. Currently trying to build my own project with a dataset from Kaggle  I've taught myself python libraries like numpy  matplotlib  and pandas. I've also been practicing writing more complex SQL queries and familiarizing myself with Tableau. I'm pretty lost on how I should approach this recruiting season and I don't know what I should do next to become a true data analyst.  My question is this: I'm reaching out to my professors for research opportunities to build real experiences  but besides that I'm curious as to which skill sets or experiences did you have when you were recruiting that gave you the edge against other candidates? What are some duties that entry level data analysts are expected to be able to do?  Thank you guys in advance

1801,-What data do you generate/work with?      Customers  calls  sales  demographics  agent information. We have a very encompassing data lake and a lot of data focusing around many different aspects of a customer.  -What languages and libraries do you use? Scala primarily  followed by Python  SQL  and R. For modeling I generally use MLLib or H20 for Spark.  -What are the most specific Machine Learning algos you use the most? LASSO and GBM/Random Forest. Also surprisingly CHAID for more descriptive focused projects.   -What are the steps you take in data processing? Pull the different tables we need from Hive usually in 3 sections  or topics. Stuff about customers accounts  stuff about calls  and stuff about equipment. The corresponding tables per section are ran through a data processing pipeline we have in spark. Everything has to be rolled up to the account level so we pre-process the data  and aggregate our features to the account level. Steps include treating dates and creating a few new features  one hot encoding low cardinality variables  binning / target encoding high cardinality  and a few other fun things.  -What are the outputs you deliver?  At this time we are waiting for a modeling platform as data science is relatively new to my company. We usually present powerpoints detailing findings (a lot of the projects are focused around “actionable insights” until we get our dev ops set up). Once we’re ready we’ll be able to put models in production and we’ll probably deliver model metrics (including financial impacts) in a dashboard or something visual.   -Typical meetings  timelines  deadlines?  We meet with subject matter experts often when starting on new projects. We also have a team meeting each day  and a weekly modeling/project update with our director. Project turn around here is a bit too quick as people don’t understand what really goes into them. People usually ask us to deliver findings in 2 weeks. It always extends as people have more questions and want more analysis.   -What Industry? Telecom
1802,I’m not a native English speaker so my grammar might be Engrishly.  From what I can remember the mc step through some kind of gate after his friend or someone else(I can’t exactly remember sorry) then end up transported into another world. Next thing I remember is that he was eating lunch then he spotted his friend and tried to follow him but when he stand up the shop owner  which is some kind of fantasy creature  stop him and tell him to finish his food. The last thing I can think of is that he fight his friend while holding a sword then a dark/black glass orb get broken or dropped.  I think I watched it in 2010 or 2011 but I’m pretty sure it is older than that.
1803,I recently replaced my laptop screen. Before replacement my laptop had 1980 x 1080 resolution and now I can't see that option. Any help is appreciated.   https://preview.redd.it/y6rmwu40d1s51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f97d1ba6e4b1f26ec527f340e675e95bc0620179
1804,I increasingly notice that there is a gap in understanding what do Data Scientists do. Many aspiring Data Scientists are then disappointed when expectations don’t meet reality. Data Science is not just about tweaking parameters of your favorite model and getting higher on the Kaggle leaderboard- **what if I told you there is no leaderboard in the real world!**   Recently  I wrote [Your First Machine Learning Model in the Cloud](https://datascienceisfun.net/) Ebook to show you how does working on an actual Data Science projects looks from start to finish. This Ebook is aimed at Data Science enthusiasts and Software Engineers who are thinking to pursue a career in Data Science.
1805,Love the main characters. Even the staff are lovable and the whole base feels like a family.  But damn that ED. Things are bound to get pretty depressing later on plus there's way too many death flags triggered this episode alone. I hope all four survive by the end.
1806,Earthdawn - Fantasy adventuring in a world after horrors from a distant plane invaded. The setting was once connected to Shadowrun  taking in place in the 4th World while Shadowrun occurred in the 6th. The system also has a unique dice pool system that makes rolling quite fun in my opinion.   Legend of the Five Rings - Rokugan  a fantasy Japan with magic and better gender equality  but the still brutal caste system. Players are typically samurai from one of the major clans. Campaigns are typically political with some fighting/dueling  but can be war focused  or with special attention against supernatural forces brought about by the shadowland taint. If you don't care much for Genesys  avoid 5e and go straight to 4e. If you're unsure  read both and decide for yourself. If you play 5e  you're stuck with the L5R specific genesys dice. If you play 4e  you've got a roll and keep d10 system that I personally love.   Scion - Not sure if you consider this part of WoD. Some do  some don't. But it takes place in modern day like its cousin splats. However  this time the players all have divine parentage. You do god stuff. On what scale and form this takes varies from game to game  and the system is divided into three tiers. Hero  Demigod  and God. Each is its own power level of play. Most start with Hero and work their way up.
1807,I can confirm all of this. Good to see that I'm not the only one having this issue. I hope they resolve it asap  because at the moment  my experience with the 3080 is worse than my experience with a 2060.  Edit: Issue is with drivers and hardware accelerated gpu scheduling. Turning hardware accelerated gpu scheduling off fixes the majority of issues.
1808,If money is tight  I would go with a 3300x. Since you've been using a 4690k until now  I'm gonna assume you don't do any video editing and mostly game on the system. The 3300x is an insane value for gaming. If you shop around it could be had for less than 100$ used
1809,Hm. I was accidental online may be 5min after Best Buy  target and gamespot offered the ps5. I couldn’t complete any of the checkouts. Utter madness.  Besides that  I find the ps5 is very attractive  I don’t mean physically (at all)  but new controllers with more rumble immersion  a great game lineup with downward compability  hard to not be tempted. If they “allow” me to buy it.
1810,First thing is why are you using URP? Do you need the features like shadergraph or the Visual effect Graph?  Or are you just trying to use the latest tech available? The built in system with something like amplify is still that way to do in most cases.  SRP just is not ready for full usage yet. As fall as the online play  there are mirror and photon api which are really good for unity.  To answer you question  a lot of depends on what you making? If you intend to release your project on mobile or switch  I would stay with Unity. If creating an realistic environment is key to your game  then unreal is your choice.   As a solo dev  I find unity to be easier to work with.  I like being able to determine how I want to implement a system instead of how does the engine want me to do it. UE4 is a team engine. The amount of features and controls that are available that is no why for one person to have reasonable understanding of all it.
1811,Heard a lot of sketchy shit about the Ubisoft culture  this doesn’t surprise me. Sorry you’re going through this though - if it’s any consolation at least you worked on one of their only games that doesn’t suck. In the long term you’ll be happy you got out of there  good luck with the next chapter.
1812,Processor should be fine.  I'd bump the ram to at least 32 if not 64gb.  I'd also bump that ssd to at least a 500gb and swap the 1tb hdd to an ssd of similar capacity.  If you start hoarding media  you can put that on a bigger spinning disk.
1813,Their shows tend to be 80% sub-par and 20% good  they are one of two studios that hold onto the archaic long-running release structure in the core anime demographic (which is the major cause of the previously established 80% sub-par animation)  and they've had some p iconic fuck ups.
1814,"It'll be interesting to see what  if anything  gets attention in the remaster. I suspect it'll be very little but ME1 in particular has some legend-level bad UX that was atrocious a decade ago  let alone today. If you haven't read it  the ""massive interface fail"" teardown is both hilarious and painfully accurate:  http://gamedesignreviews.com/reviews/mass-effect-interface-fail/  Things improve tremendously as the series progresses  but I worry that we're going to have a lot of people who forgot all of the first game's rough edges get a small case of Paris syndrome as they eagerly jump into a 13-year-old game with a mediocre 20-year-old interface."
1815,Let’s be honest: PS5 preorders could have been a lot smoother. We truly apologize for that.   Over the next few days  we will release more PS5 consoles for preorder – retailers will share more details.    And more PS5s will be available through the end of the year.   ***  posted by [@PlayStation](https://twitter.com/PlayStation)  Photos in tweet |  [Photo 1](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EiSwM0EUcAAl5C2.jpg)   ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username)
1816,I actually think a 1650 pairs fairly well with a 10400. Only thing I'm hesitant about is that card is about 2 years old now. Could wait a bit longer to see what AMD launches later this month. For 1080p gaming I think this will work well. I'd also recommend dropping in an SSD. Overall  price-to-performance is lacking  but that's always going to be the case when buying a prebuilt.
1817,>  While today you can develop a great game with descent graphics and story  etc for less than $100. Hell mods that can be the size and quality of real published games with entire campaigns  voice acting multiplayer modes  etchave been produced costing nothing.  I'm going to strongly disagree with that $100 figure.  But let's just assume it's real.  How much *time* does it take to make these games and these mods?  This is highly skilled labor in software engineering  digital art  music composition  and a bunch of other disciplines also.  Maybe it is done for fun  maybe it is done for a profile piece.  But the people doing that could be paid quite handsomely for this work  in games or in another industry.  If you want a good looking game or in-depth mod done in a reasonable time frame  it's not going to happen on nights and weekends only.  Thus an opportunity cost that is considerably above $100 will be incurred.
1818,I have a ton of fantasy miniatures and I enjoy tactical games like Divinity Original Sin a lot so I was looking for a game that translates that feeling to the table.  I also enjoy narrative RPGs so I don't want to give rid of that part in a pure combat/skirmish game like Frostgrave or Warhammer. I've been using D&D 5e and works for me but I was wondering what other games would you suggest for that kind of playstyle.
1819,Honestly you can watch them at any time. They are pretty stand-alone for the most part. Personally I didn't until I finished the series. I think that gave me some good context for them so I would reccomend that option.
1820,"If you wish to create your own. There are a few ways to do this. You need a plug (positive of panel) to create the mold (negative of panel) You can use modified existing panels with material built up on them (clay or such) to create impromptu panels.  The ""proper"" way to create these panels is to use 3d scanning to take the shape and critical dimensions  model the panels in a CAD program - machine the panels out of epoxy tooling board with a 3-5 axis cnc router - use mold making composite (i know carbon fiber has specific mold layups) - layup - bag and resin infuse for fiberglass"
1821,4Runner/Tacoma bros. Tons of em praise the reliability and resale  but don't acknowledge they're driving a car that hasn't really advanced since 2003. A lot of them will also spend well over 5k on a car from 2000 with almost 300k miles and act like they perfected the art of the deal. Crazy stuff.  Edit: I own a 4Runner and love it  I can just recognize it's a dinosaur.

1823,As someone who does not have an office job  degree  or programming experience  what are some valuable resources for learning and applying what I learn for data analytics or science? I’m currently taking a udemy course on python for data science and while I find the info intriguing for a potential future in this niche  I’m hoping to find better Courses or ways of learning. The topics just seem so narrowly introduced I’m having a hard time grasping the importance of them. Thanks!
1824,I wouldn't say that is murder hobo  from what you are saying.  It sounds like the player just enjoys combat most.  I a lot of players are like that.  They don't feel confident role playing  so fights are the best part of the game for them.    As a player someone like that would be fine  but I wouldn't spend a lot of effort trying to talk them down.  Just don't go with him when he runs off half cocked to kill something he isn't ready for.  Let his character kill themselves.  Just say no.
1825,Data science refers to too many things to be bucketed into one category  and I think efforts to do so are unproductive. Certain parts of DS may be more in the purview of one discipline than another  but in the end it's *all* interdisciplinary  which is what makes it exciting and which is why there's always more to learn.  Personally  what underlies this field is the idea of reasoning with data and that's universal and never going away. And to reason with data you need stats  math  domain knowledge etc - and that's never going away. Algorithms/models are a dime a dozen  but this is the stuff that can't be automated. And every additional abstraction you layer-in to simplify it puts you more at risk of making a mistake.    Treating everything in DS as an engineering problem is a flawed and limited world view. If all you have is a hammer  everything looks like a nail. DS is interdisciplinary by nature and there will never be a time when it isn't.
1826,Mythras has a Mythic Earth series  across various historical times. Combat is detailed and varied  if you want to use magic there are 5 different systems representing different traditions which vary enormously in power. Outside of magic the rules are quite realistic   skill based with no levels or feats  while still giving PCs an edge.
1827,If they actually wanted people to be able to get the cards  **they would allow the cards to be backordered**. Despite all of the apologies and justifications they have made  there is still no reason why they don't allow the cards to be backordered or allow other retailers to backorder cards. Are we going to have to keep trying to grab the GPUs in the maybe 10 seconds before they sell out for the next couple months? it's such a dumb process
1828,"As it happens  there's a scenario with four premade characters designed to introduce Fate to players and game masters in my [free quickstart for *Return to the the Star*s](https://msabalau.itch.io/return-to-the-stars).  I've successfully run it for a lot of new players at conventions  and the adventure also includes guidance for a new GM.   More generally  I wouldn't worry that much about ""running it wrong""--Fate is actually fairly robust--it's not a finicky rules engine that falls apart if you apply a rule slightly wrong."
1829,The problem as others have said is finding a trustworthy mechanic. I like cars  I don't understand mechanical stuff very well  it's just been something I've never been good at learning  it makes me feel wildly inadequate.  It turns out I recently needed my entire exhaust and catalyser and its pollution sensors replaced  and was offered three different prices by three different garages with ostensibly the same parts - mostly. The problem is that they all diagnosed slightly different problems as well - and all of them told me to forget about the codes my OBD2 scanner was showing (I only bought it for buying cars but thought they might be interested in what it had to say).  I of course bow down to their superior knowledge  I wasn't blustering about  I'm just trying to a) help and b) not get utterly screwed.   I went for the slightly more expensive  but friendlier and seemingly more trustworthy garage but of course... the pollution warning lamp lit itself again the other day. The thing is: he told me to come back and he'd check it again and look at what's going on and fix it. But how do I know he's being honest when he gives me the next invoice? Do I really need to be rotating garages and getting three quotes each time? It drives me nuts that it can't just be *easy*  there's always someone trying to game you. The only good garage is one recommended by a friend who knows them personally. Anything else is Russian roullette.
1830,I can relate  but at the same time... I keep that stuff around and use it eventually.   I'd say that in the *long* run  I use at least 50% of what I prep  it just might be 10 runs later than originally planned.
1831,Thanks for the hints of what awaits me when trying to set up docker next week! I knew there was a good reason to postpone that.  The link to the actual github is hard to find  only in your bio. First I thought that new notebook is hypothetical.
1832,Electric cars will become more and more popular as battery costs go down. With that  the charging infrastructure will increase which will have a positive feedback on ev sales   Unless there are some major advances in hydrogen production and storage hydrogen cars will likely remain a niche market.
1833,The lack of SLI connectors hurt more for the 3080 in workstations  where its relative value make for 2x 3080 to be super fast vs 3090. Games haven't supported mGPU well for ages so gamers aren't missing much.
1834,Is your only real contact via email? Lots of folks here saying it may be them skimming free labor/getting new ideas for free. Can you talk to your recruiter  assuming you have one? If there is anyone you can talk to that’s even pretending to be on your side  I would at least start with “can you give me an idea of how this typically works?”  Recruiters are not your friend  remember (I ran a small consulting firm for many years)  but it might help you catch important details as well as a bigger picture. Best of luck.
1835,"You can look into junior level data scientist jobs since you have a BS in applied mathematics and have done projects in this field  but just know that they are very competitive (based on what I hear from my colleagues and see in this sub). Try applying to both DA and Jr. data scientist roles? I don't think working as a DA means ""wasting time and losing skills"". You can always work up from there to work in DS and work on side projects."
1836,Judging by this episode. I bet that the memories of everyone are messed up  including Towa  I think her  memories are incomplete and the flashback we saw were faded memories from Towa  it wasn't what really happened  at least not completely.  Also  mark my words: Towa's teacher is someone in disguise!

1838,That it runs fine with a jump  but won't restart is stereotypical behavior of a cooked battery.    If a battery goes dead dead  like by being drained for 40 days and 40 nights after it already has some years on it   it starts to like to be dead.    2 months ago when Ford checked it was fine.  Since then it was drained further than a lead acid likes to go.  I'd fight it a bit if the battery was <1yo  otherwise just replace the battery (12volt  not the big one)   In a 4yo car it seems likely it's a 4yo battery.
1839,Headline is yet again  wrong.   He said  of the thousands they've tested  99% have worked.   I would fully expect most of them to work  but please temper your expectations from what is being said.   We also have no idea how well they work yet.   Hopefully  everything is good.
1840,Hi  I plan on making a campaign based on the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games.   So far I plan on using the Risus d6 system to do so  I just need some advice on how to handle status effects using this system.   Any advice would much appreciated.   Sleep would be just the usual few turns of being asleep where the victim has to roll against what the enemy's roll into wake up. Or until they his 5 turns.   Same with frozen  but that's all I got.  Thanks.  Edit: Thanks for all the advice! It all really helped.
1841,These things are a disappointment no non-x models? Meaning that to get a 6 core it's $120 more  $300 for a 6 core is a joke... These things are a big disappointment I know people will say it's faster than intel for the same price and I can't really argue it's not a better buy in most ways. But it's lead it's tiny over intel in every game that isn't csgo  I own a 9900k so I won't buy this it's a bad value in comparison to ryzen 3000 and there's no incentive for me to upgrade.  It's just a price increase  and for realistic gaming workloads like 4k or 1440p it won't be much better than a 3700x or something similar anyway so it's not the crushing of intel it could have been.
1842,"It is possible to clone everything on your 850 EVO using [""Acronis True Image WD Edition Software 2020""](https://support.wdc.com/downloads.aspx)  The Black SN750 won't really feel much faster than your 850 EVO unless the EVO is full or mostly full and has slowed down because of that.  Either way you'll likely need a utility to notice the difference."
1843,It's driving me insane I can't find the issue and I haven't taken it to a mechanic...at around 25 miles an hour something starts to rattle either in the middle of the car on in the back like a loose part and makes a constant annoying noisse then at around 35-40 miles an hour it goes away. This only happens in roads that are not perfect  very flat well done roads it doesn't happen.  Even after small imperfections in the road the car does this at those speeds  Lexus Is250 2014 65k miles  Any idea what can it be?
1844,it wasnt even the timing. it was their relative lack of capitol. now they have kick ass cpu and will probably have decent mid range gpu.  while nvidia will have kick ass gpu and meh cpu. for a while. though this is very interesting to see where it goes. i dont expect arm to take over on the desktop  but it would build an arm pc for the fun of it if i could actually build the whole thing from scratch like i can a x86 pc

1846,Was recently involved in the development of a retro 2D game which exclusively uses 8x8 pixel tiles for its graphics.  I am tinkering with a new engine  also tile-based  and have come to an interesting question.  Can anyone share some pros or cons for even tile sizes  as opposed to odd tile sizes?  Specifically  I am trying to decide between 8x8 or 9x9 pixel tiles.  *Performance  scaling  and resolutions are non-issues for my purposes.*   There were multiple points during the development of the previous title where I found the lack of a center-line inconvenient. I haven't yet made a game using 9x9 tiles (or even heard of one)  so I'm unsure what inconveniences might lie in wait.  With even tiles  there is no center-line to a tile - meaning  for example  if I want a centered line  it's going to have to be 2px thick.  Same would go for a dot.  With odd tiles  I would have a center-line  and can always use 2x2 squares of tiles in the event that I do need something to be even-numbered (18x18).  I think fonts will work either way  it's only a question of which size they were drawn for.  Can anyone offer further considerations before I make a decision? I would really appreciate it!
1847,Just saw double the rate...double of 0 is still 0. Also  until they decide to take a stand against smurfing  which is just MMR avoiding  and not making unlimited accounts free and ez mode  they’re not going to fix anything. If players joke about getting banned and just making another account now  what’s going to change?
1848,Check out Protocol Buffers. It's a set of tools from Google that lets you define messages in a protobuf format  and then from these messages you can generate serializing/deserializing code automatically.

1850,I would love to find a good mechanic in my area  they are all backed up for weeks and usually only work during normal business hours which means I have to take time off from work and leave my car there for days. I imagine anyone can come here to set up shop and make a KILLING.
1851,In [THIS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ZGblO6jm4YQ)  I tackle the tough question that a lot of fantasy RPGs foster and don’t address  how does your party dispose of 24x +2 magic swords?     Magic items are the coveted treasure pieces of Dungeon and Dragons and games of similar ilk. Typically  the settings are clearly derivative of Lord of the Rings and feature small hamlets dotting a countryside where the year’s harvest seems to be the major concern of commerce. But what about the economy of magical items?     Like it or not  “Ye Old Magic Shoppe” have become a staple of dungeon fantasy gaming. The party assembles for a task  gores to a location and slays a bunch of bad guys  and comes back with their booty. The ultimate aim of this acquisition of fantasy wealth will be for the characters to gain more powerful gear to kill yet more powerful monsters.     Adventuring becomes an ascending power curve that both Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons have embraced. Character stats change dynamically over time both with the benefits of level  and with the new abilities the characters have gained from their more powerful gear. Online discussions center around “build optimization” and having the right magic gear is part and parcel to that.   This fosters an economy of exchange by which player characters can liquidate their unwanted magic items and trade them in for the items that they do want. This kind of magic item commodity exchange was certainly not part of the Lord of the Rings. If it were to exist  it would require an entire industry to evaluate the items  transport them  catalog them  advertise them to interested buyers  arrange for financing  and serve as a financial intermediary between the interested parties.    In other words  the magic item industry is a product of modern thinking about value  markets  and the easy of transportation of both commodities and wealth. An actual medieval society would have none of that. Even if we allow the wizards guild to come in and serve this function  said organization would be hard pressed to deal with the concentration of wealth that your average party attempts to liquidate after an adventure.   The entire scenario drowns out the fantasy of a simply medieval life. I liked the idea presented in XCrawl  that dungeon adventurers were modern sports figures who went through prepared dungeons for the excitement of studio audiences because that now answers all the obvious questions about where the wealth that the adventures recover came from and where it is going.   Unfortunately  no one else likes or seems to have heard of XCrawl. People want their Lord of the Rings setting. Albeit  with a “Ye Old Magic Shoppe” located in The Shire.    In this video  I make my suggestion as to how to better address the problem. I divide magic loot into three categories:  Hearing magic meant to keep the player characters in action Mysterious magic items that could be powerful boons or secretly cursed that the PCs will need to explore in t

1853,RuneQuest.  Crunch  but not PF1 levels. It is the origin of the BRP system  so same basic mechanics as Call of Cthulhu. Plus the setting is Glorantha  which is awesome.  Free quickstart at https://www.chaosium.com/runequest-quickstart-1/  The Dresden Files  which is FATE based. Certainly no grid in that system. And it might motivate your group to read some really good books
1854,Why can't the weak just stay down? Yup  that's definitely Sesshoumaru's blood. And lol at the two cousins already in a fight.   That preview. A bluish green energy blade with a familiar fluffy hilt-guard...is Towa Bakusaiga's inheritor? Or perhaps a similar type of blade since demons can get their own swords from their body parts? And hah  Moroha definitely looks like her dad's human form with her hair down.
1855,"Impressive performance consistency and great battery life  though that's likely due to the ""finally back to normal"" 60+ WHr battery capacity.  What's the TDP / PL1? The load of 65C after 20 Cinebench runs is pretty solid for a single-fan  single-heatsink ULV laptop.  I don't understand why Tom's Hardware doesn't do more web-based performance tests  this is what 90% of people who buy premium notebooks do today. Electron  CEF  Chrome  JavaScript  etc. It scales well with single-core and multi-core tests  so there's interesting data to be had."

1857,"So  I actually own a fairly substantial business (a venture capital firm)  and can dig through this stuff better than most.  My initial theory after looking at all this (and looking at some things people didn't think to look at  such as their D&B  corporate officer filings  etc.) is that this is  in fact  a shell company under another shell company (that being the US MSI subsidiary) under the Micro-Star umbrella company.  It's telling to me that the company's officers are all employees of US MSI - including the shell company's CEO  who is the president of sales for MSI USA.  My theory on this - and this is ONLY A THEORY - is that this shell company's purpose is to re-sell inventory that was deemed not fit for retail packaged sales.  Items that would be listed as ""factory reconditioned"" if they had ever actually been in a consumer's hands  but don't have to be listed that way because the defects were caught in manufacturing.  The fact that most of the other items this company on eBay and Amazon sells are at or slightly below retail lends credence to that.  I doubt what they're doing is ""scalping"" their retail supply.  MSI is a 35 billion dollar company on the Taiwanese exchange.  I do  however  think it entirely possible that they're being incredibly scammy selling cards that failed the silicon lottery as brand new without telling their customers that they're paying top dollar for a card that failed inspection previously.  The next most likely explanation is a lot more nefarious - some fraud going on within the company by which stock is being siphoned off for personal gain under the company's nose."
1858,"Intel's 10nm is probably more than good enough for the company to compete with TSMC's 7N+. However  as Mr. Swan (Intel's CEO) already admitted it is not their best node and probably not productive as their 14nm. The company still has some time to develop a ""proper"" 7nm node as Zen 4 with 5nm probably won't fully hit the market until 2022 even though it is suggested to be released in 2021.   Intel doesn't need go fabless and they are financially healthy to remain as an IDM. It is just a question 'when' they would catch up with AMD  not an 'if'.  Out of three remaining companies with advanced nodes  Intel  TSMC and Samsung  it seems like TSMC is in the most vulnerable position. Intel will always dominate the x86 market and have tons of money for R&D. Samsung Semiconductor's the most lucrative business is memory and they will remain happy as long as they could recoup some returns for their investments from Austin & Korean fabs and stay somewhat competitive with TSMC.  On the other hand  TSMC only has a foundry business and they are increasingly relient on Apple (dedicating their entire 5nm lines to Apple) as slowly losing some of their traditional customers (i.e. Qualcomm and Nvidia) to Samsung. At least with 7nm  TSMC had both Qualcomm's 8xx and Apple  but with 5nm  it is just Apple. GF was never much of a serious threat to TSMC  but Samsung Foundry which has just proved with Nvidia that they could manufacture big dies as well is different. They have money  technology and other parts that they could offer as a package (memory  display  power IC  CMOS camera sensor and etc).  At the point it is unthinkable as Samsung's smartphone business is quite profitable  but if Samsung concedes that there is no much of future in the increasingly competitive Android phone market and decides to go a full electronics & semiconductor company  what would stop Apple from contracting Samsung to manufacture their chips as Samsung no longer competes against Apple in the smartphone market? Samsung probably could offer a nice discount for their package of semiconductors  display and electronics to all Android OEM as well.  However  I think TSMC will remain a dominant force in foundry business in at least the next 5 years or so as it has always been in the last 2 decades  but I don't think their lead in the node technology over Intel may not last very long and Samsung may be posed to become a bigger threat to them than the market share in the foundry market suggests at the moment."
1859,I couldn't watch more than a couple episodes of *Promised Neverland*.  I tried to like it  but there was just something about it's premise that I found too gruesome and couldn't get myself to go any further.  Perhaps I'll revisit the series one of these days  but for right now its been a consistent no-go for me.  Beyond that... I stopped watching *Golden Kamuy* because of the violence  but gave it a second try several weeks later and ended up finishing it.
1860,Technically  anything that can tap into DirectX  OpenGL or Vulkan.  > I have almost no experience with C#  but the whole MS ecosystem-centricity seems a little meh.  C# was MS-centric a decade or so ago. Mono was the first step towards cross-platforming it  and now we have .NET Core.  There's nothing about C# that's specific to Windows only.
1861,I don't see it as reflective of the state of the course by itself. Finance instos and insurance cos are big employers of data scientists  many of them use SAS. Maybe the lecturer just wanted to expose you to a tool that many employers use that is also hard to access for free (unlike R/ Python) to give you an edge in the job market. More generally  it is common enough that employers arbitrarily change the available tool for their reasons (i.e. not your reasons) that learning to be flexible about such things is a useful skill in the workplace.

1863,Hopefully this is true  and they can take advantage of the way better gyro tech that the joycons have. I think people would be shocked at how fun the game is when they aren’t fighting the motion controls.   I didn’t personally have a huge issue with them  though they definitely weren’t perfect by any means.
1864,I am not a gamedev obviously. Nor do I have a lot of knowledge on different games  as I mostly played big name titles till 2012. My only two games since have been uncharted 4 and spider man (thanks PlayStation 4 in the community zone of my apartment). So  obviously  some of these ideas might be too difficult  impossible to do etc. But I wanted to share them anyway. Just in case  some people might use these ideas for their next indie title.   Anyway  the list of ideas.  1) A game where we move from one era of gaming to the next. With SSD  it should be easy to do  but I don't know. Idea is that we choose few eras of gaming history and take the most iconic game from that era. I.e. mario bros from NES  halo from Xbox etc. The story follows a time traveller searching for a macguffin (doesn't matter). We play as the protagonist which starts in the current era of gaming  and between the levels  switch to a different era. We might even be able to switch from a first person perspective to a side scrolling platformer or a puzzle game. Again  it is just something I had a thought about  not sure if it will work.   2) A true assassination game. Not unlike hitman  except we don't have a fixed period for assassination. Just a target  an end date for assassination contract. Say assassinating a musician before their next tour. Calendar moves forward for the whole game  instead of every mission. So  if player takes 5 days for first mission instead of 10  he/she can then use the extra days to plan the next mission. Planning meticulously will cause next few missions to have less time  but planning badly will result in failure and require player to stay underground for few days. Total 10 missions over 100 days for the whole story. Missions will have options to follow the target for few days to learn their weakness  find the best time when they are alone  or just go to market and buy a sniper and take a chance on your shooting ability. We can have options like infiltrate security detail or loot the id card from a guard or convince the security or try to sneak in. Basically whole game is planning the mission with 100s of possible routes. Sort of like GTA 5 heists but way more options. We can easily have extremely detailed world design considering it will be mostly limited. Or even go for a top down camera route  if budget is the concern. Game should have tons of replayability as there will be thousands of paths for a player to take. This is actually the most interesting idea I want someone to build on. Because this is the type of game that I will love to play over and over.   3) A racing game set in 3d city based on Google earth or bing maps data. Just a full city  with options to find races at night. You can choose any building as your safe house  within that city. And then roam around at night  trying to find Street races. Talk to different NPCs  talk to garage owners  bribe a shady looking guy in alley. Different mechanisms so that you will find info about a possibl
1865,...because both are cool.   Text blocks incoming. I'm posting this because i'd like to work this up as a setting. I love 40k  I love some of the wierd stuff in SLA (always had a soft spot for it). Even a little bit of Shadowrun  and some Mutant Chronicles (I envisage this set in the solar system not the greater galaxy. So imagine a world that's a baroque corporate state. IE: a corporation (the Guild in this case) instead of the Imperium. And a little bit less war.   Feedback is appreciated. I'm sure some or none of this will make sense :D  \*\*\*  Before the Guild’s existence  the Solworlds (the solar system) were controlled by the Imperium. That time has gone leaving only relics and secrets. While the Lord Protector still holds the Dragon Adamant Throne  his position is ceremonial. The real power lies in the Highspires of Haloheim  the exclusive Guild enclave at the heart of Terragard City (Coruscant + Holy Terra +Mega City 1).   This is the greatest city in human experience. A vast choking morass of industrial overload. Everyone and everything has a price  all overseen - likely provided - by the merchant masters of the Guild.   **The Guild**  The merchant lords that survived the civil war that destroyed the Imperium gained power following a deal with the entity known as Midnight. The entity created by the Arcadian Rite of Samhain. They would receive the power they craved  using it to create the Guild. But after a thousand years Midnight would come to claim their souls. That time is now.  Throughout its history the governing Syndicate  who know the truth  believed that  when the time came  they would have the means to destroy Midnight. To that end they created the Watchtower faction. It’s purpose: to protect against Midnight and related supernatural threats.   The Watchtower  using the stolen knowledge contained within the Deck of Souls  would find a way to destroy Midnight. However the Watchtower has grown apart from the Guild  following claims of heresy and betrayal.   The Guild now stands on a precipice while the forces of Midnight gather  manifesting now through the appearance of the Witchsigns.  **Arcadians**  An ancient people that existed throughout the Solworlds. They traded with vast and ancient entities and were possessed of magical powers known as Glamours. They lived as clans aboard their Vardofleets that sailed the stars.  The Rite of Samhain was conducted thousands of years ago. The elder Arcadians sensed that Glamour power  growing unrestrained  was threatening to corrupt them. The purpose of the Rite was the cutting of that dark part  restrain it  and use it for good  to transcend. What it created was a dangerous god  the entity known as Midnight.   It spoke to a few of the Arcadians who were weak enough to listen and drove a schism that created civil war. The Hecatrix are those Arcadians that are now essentially powerful slaves of Midnight. The Arcadians are themselves diminished  living in ‘Glamour Ghettoes’  mystical otherworl
1866,Sounds like they utilized the software ShareFile^((TM)) (requires at least peer-to-peer network setup)  or they simply had a file server setup  and the shortcut to said file share was placed on the C:\\ of each computer.  Did you have to sign in with company-provided credentials to each machine you used? Or were there generic credentials everyone shared? If personal credentials  likely the company had a domain  which means the file server was domain-joined  and through said domain  rights were put on each computer using something called Group Policy  giving those with the policy applied to their accounts  rights to the file share you saw on C:\\.
1867,Nothing changed. Cyberpunk 2077 is a single player game with zero microtransactions. One single purchase. No tricks. Don't believe the clickbait.   ***  posted by [@CyberpunkGame](https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame)  ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username)
1868,Holy shit. AOTS so far for me  and its not even close. Fucking brilliant  loved it. Nana is a fantastic protagonist  and I love the way she takes on these superpowered people. Also extremely curious of the other transfer student.  Damn  so good.
1869,Hi everyone   I'm applying to post-grad entry level DS roles (I will soon have an MS in Statistics + \~1.5 years in data analyst work experience  which includes some DS work / internships)  and I've gotten good responses so far from employers that explicitly have positions that are catered to new graduates.  However  should I also be applying to any DS role that is listed as entry level  even if not specific to new grads? Especially considering that my graduation date is in \~ 9 months?  Many thanks for your advice!
1870,If we are talking about the offroad SUV space on the FJ Cruiser you could get rear locker  A-TRAC  16 inch rims etc. with the basic Off-road Package which had almost no luxury/cosmetic items tacked on at all. You go could go full Trail Teams and get more stuff but the Offroad package really was a good value. That's the one I had for a bit and loved it.             But now I have the luxury and no rear locker and I love that too...
1871,Currently an engineer at a product development company and realized that the two main things I hate are 1. Deadlines with hardware deliverables and 2. Documentation like protocols and engineering drawings.   I hate all the deadlines and stress associated with this kind of job. Been thinking about changing careers into data science and was wondering how the stress and pace of these jobs are? Of course there’s no mechanical portion. But are there also insane and totally unachievable deadlines??
1872,Hi there after looking through the tips I just wonder.. I just graduated from polytechnic(which is similar to high school) and am looking to enter college.What degrees are recommended to enter data science?Im looking at a data science bachelors or information systems bachelors.  Next Ive always liked studying math and statistics actually way more than coding.Sometimes coding just feels like mental pain when debugging or trying to figure out what’s wrong.Or when you read a bunch of code written by someone and you don’t know what’s going on and you feel intimidated at first.Despite this  sometimes I enjoy coding when it works or when the struggle is manageable.So do you think I would be suited for Data science if I like maths and am  decent at it but dislikes coding sometimes? (assume my coding to be average and I’m not a rockstar coder) My experience with Data Science is in plotting visualizations in Tableau and so far I seem to be enjoying that aspect as Good Data visualizations are quite simple to create in tableau(at least to me). I am very familiar with Building websites and I kinda dislike it alot at times.So I’m not sure if I will like A career in data science since they both require coding.People say that math and coding ability are correlated(meaning if one is good at coding he will be good at math) but I doubt that it’s true. What do you think?Thanks for the reply in advance :)
1873,Electricity HAS TO BE a traceable big bang event in any sci-fi setting. It couldn't have always been there because if it had been there then EVERYONE would be an electrician. Seriously  you could send your kid to college to learn some craft OR you could hire an online tutor to teach him to code a robot to work for him  or create shoes  or deliver all of his wares anywhere in the world.  because if enough electricity is in the world that there are backdoors and drones and all kinds of other stuff it means that people have built up defenses against all those electronics. Hacking HAS TO BE USELESS because it has been around so long that multiple people have started up hack proofing businesses.  Electricity HAS TO BE everywhere to the point that everything is already known. with researchers and wikis and satellites there would be nothing left to explore or discover and the world would be more focused on swaying the opinion of the masses (okay  that last bit is actually true lol  but like  when has it ever not been?).  Nothing makes sense. You can’t even define “reality”. Embrace the fantasy.
1874,IDK about the Z2 but this little puppy is pretty much 'dance with who brung ya'. In other words  not much CAN be upgraded. A bigger SSD  yes but that is not much help in gaming.  Specs:  [https://support.hp.com/ca-en/document/c06101574](https://support.hp.com/ca-en/document/c06101574)
1875, Log in to your G Suite account at admin.google.com.  Navigate to Device Management > Chrome Management > User Settings.  Scroll down to Security.  Select the 'Disallow incognito mode' option from the dropdown for the Incognito Mode field.
1876,So I'm a DM in my group of friends and I was looking for an idea that was interesting. I came upon a Settlement building Sandbox Campaign set in a Post-Apocalyptic world. It would have enemies like that of those in the Resident Evil games  but also with slow zombies. Does anyone have any systems this would work in  ideas for storylines  or rough tech trees that might work?
1877,Does it really cost that much more to keep it on the American market considering it is still being produced internationally  already certified for sale in America and the techs are already trained on it?
1878,I'm sad Ikebukuro isn't here. That show has so much potential.  Akudama has a lot of potential too. I'm gonna call it  if it's done well it'll be best anime of the year.  Tonikawa is really adorable. If I die of diabetes you know who's fault is.  Jujutsu Kaisen is amazing. I hope MAPPA doesn't pull a GoH on us and speedrun the story. Again.   Assault Lily seems good. It's made by Shaft  so it can be really good. Nothing else to say.  I haven't seen Adachi and Shimamura yet  how is it? No spoilers please.  I'm standing on 1 million lives is a generic bad isekai with powerpoint animations. Nothing else to say.  Noblesse is kinda boring so far ngl
1879,I had an uncle who had one of these.   The most memorable part of it as a kid was the weird leather on the door panels.  That  and I remember my grandpa calling it the “ugliest damn car” he had ever seen.
1880,Definitely theoretically possible  but you'll have to reverse engineer the data format the game uses to store level geometry  meshes  textures and everything else that goes into it  then write code to reassemble the entire scene in a different file format based on the game's own data.
1881,1) Mercenaries trying to get back home after the big battle between good and evil (good won  but lost so many easy modes of transport) and now have to get back home. Set piece beginning of the players each making 5 or so characters and seeing which ones survive the initial final battle and become PCs. Any unkilled/unplayed pcs become the other survivors of the mercenary company. Sessions would involve solving problems in a chaotic world now freed from a millennia of tyranny and discovering lost secrets:   2) Two sets of 'players'  one group is playing regular adventurers in a political turbulent region and are trying to be heroes/make lots of money through their combat skills and daring. The other group of players would be the rulers of the political factions  playing in a more long term format (play by post) and in competition with each other to rule the land. The regular player's adventurers would impact the political players  who in turn could change things for the regular players.  3) A campaign set in a world generated by a game of Small World (preferably with as many expansions and players as possible).  4) What seems like a generic fantasy game but turns into a desperate fight for survival against a sci-fi alien civilization that is invading.
1882,He literally took thousands of dollars to do paid propaganda from them a couple days back  i am pretty sure he sold out big for that one  lost my respect along the way  Gamers nexus completely shredded him and everyone else that made an ''8K GAMING'' video.
1883,So maybe no one can help me here  but I am doing some analysis of ellipsometric data. The txt files are a bit messy so I have to dick around with them a bit before they'll be imported via genfromtxt. Then I have to feed them through some loops to get every 3rd row into its own array or something like that  depending on the file. Anywho  at the end of the day I need to plot a bunch of shit. So I am wondering if pandas would be at all useful here or if I am better off just sticking with numpy?
1884,2019 STI. My winters are one size down  18 v 19.   Pros: Comfort. My 18s are lighter and acceleration from dead stop seems faster. Clutch is easier to engage.   Cons: A little vague steering feel. This could also be because of the winter tires. It’s not too bad you kinda only notice it on micro adjustments.   I don’t push my car hard enough to tell you extreme handling characteristics.
1885,"For a bit of background  I am a final year CS student and I'd like to release a mobile  Web or desktop game by the end of 2021. I love programming and I have used C# in a project before. I've used Unreal Engine but it's really resource intensive and I hate C++. I made a game in Unity but that was mostly following along a tutorial and I don't want to fall into the tutorial loop.   How best can I learn Unity to make ""ok"" 2D games? Any books? Any videos? Should I get the ""Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D"" by Ben Tristem on Udemy? Is it worth it? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks."
1886,Best comment was suggesting to pull back some of the carpet. FWIW: Having owned 15-20 year old cars that spent their whole life in Massachusetts  the rust in pictures seems moderate and not too bad at all
1887,first of all  /r/whowouldwin  second of all  GER  third of all  Meruem isnt even stronger then many antagonists in other popular shounen. He just dwarfs most of the characters in HxH which makes him feel overwhelmingly strong
1888,"A friend and his siblings had a family joke about an 'asbestos squid chicken' when they were growing up. The friend would occasionally reference it to us when we were in college. Fast forward  he ran a dungeon crawl and  sure enough  we ran into this fire-resistant chicken/squid thing. It wasn't until after (many tense moments) we dispatched the thing that one of us realized  ""hey  was that...."""
1889,"Hello!  I have a problem I just can't get my head around. I have bought a KVM-switch to try and connect all my retro-computers with one console. This is not my first KVM-switch  but this one is the first with ""all in one"" cable though  the ones I've had before have been single cable connections.  I have 2 ""4 in 1 KVM cable"" with 2x PS/2  VGA and USB. I can get picture... but only on one computer at the time  and only from the first slot (number 1 on the switch). And the one of the more confusing parts is that thats the only one that doesn't lights up the LEDs... :S  I don't get any keyboard recognition either. And i've tried many different keyboards and mices  no dice on any of them. I've even tried USB to PS/2 adapter  but no connection there either.  I am really stumped here  I've made sure of a couple of troubleshooting steps   Checked all LEDs  they all lit up.  Checked all cables  everything is giving connection on a multimeter (beep test)  Firmware is updated  and there is no problem connecting it to update it.  I have tried many power adapters  all 5v 2a.  The manual is only a ""User Manual""  which doesn't show any PCB-layout or any of the Jumper Settings...  If anyone could please help me  I would be forever grateful!"
1890,"Bad shows:  Conception   Taboo-Tattoo   Isekai Cheat Magician   Lord of Vermilion   Big Order   Ousama Game The Animation  cool OP song though   Endride   Divine Gate  [great OP though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLWD-DcP0ko)   Mayoiga - I personally think this one is ""so bad  it's good"""
1891,The transistors used to make the mobile vs desktop processors could be different so it's hard to tell. One simple example is that 60pp transistor mentioned in 10nm Superfin. I'd expect more 60pp transistors to be used in parts of the chip outside of the Core+CCF+MC to give it much more VDD headroom.  The other issue would be the power delivery network which I don't think would scale well when taking mobile design and bumping up the VDD. From the get-go  if I were to design the power rails and power domains for desktop part  I would go for different rail values and that means my PVT conditions for stdcells like level shifters and retention flops would be different hence my signoff margins change.
1892,I'm not familiar with the series but I understand that's always been s Playstation exclusive. I'm I right ir wrong?
1893,"I think a lot of enthusiasts get bent out of shape not because of any notion of ""purity"" but because a lot of say  M-Sport or S-Line or whatever cars... aren't actually particularly faster or more fun than the base model.  That kind of dilution can *discourage* people getting interested in cars  because when a layman tests out a car they *think* is a faster version  but it's not  they wonder what all the fuss is about.  They don't realize they're driving a car with an appearance package and maybe a slightly firmer suspension.  So that kind of kills their gateway into knowing what *really* driving a performance car feels like.  &nbsp   As an example I can actually bring up from real life  I had a guy tell me  when he saw my Golf R  that ""He had one too."" When I asked him about it... It was an *R-Line Tiguan.*  Which is just a Tiguan with a sporty appearance package and firmer suspension.  He wasn't actually aware that the *real* R cars have fundamental mechanical changes in them  and that kind of put me in a situation where I just had to smile and nod for fear of sounding elitist or condescending.    &nbsp    Another  sort of stupid and indirect example (if not this exact phenomenon  but of appearance packages flying too close to the real thing)  is I knew a guy with an ""OZ Rally Edition"" Mitsubishi Lancer  he legitimately  sincerely thought he had an Evo  and even thought to get butthurt and call Evo's ""overrated"" when people beat him in stoplight races.  &nbsp   At the same time  I have zero problems with the ""lesser"" AMG or M cars that maybe aren't the full-bore experience  but still offer an actual taste of it with real performance gains over the base model at a budget more people can afford."
1894,"I've been DMing for 27 years now. And before EVERY session I get that tingling sensation just before I am about to kick things off. And after every session  I always doubt myself. I am my biggest critic. But I think 99% of that is in my head. My players more than enjoy me sessions. It's hard to shake that feeling  but I think any ""performance"" carries that with it!  Just my two cents!"
1895,I prefer R for data analysis and visualization  and do not agree with the assertion it’s becoming “niche.” That said  as an undergrad CS student  your time is probably better spent continuing to sharpen your Python skills.
1896,https://cloroxmaelstrom.itch.io/dragon-hoards  This was made for the Turn Based Tactics Jam. I spent quite a lot of time on it  so I'd hope y'all like it. There is a one page RPG version of it  for nice and easy printing.  I would love to hear what you think!
1897,If memory serves the ps3 ran some freebsd based OS. It could be the case that the server ran that as well and the driver exists for freebsd rather than for linux. Though I think there were reports of the us navy (or airforce maybe?) using clusters of ps3's with linux for processing. Interesting hole you're diving down. Do you plan to write up an article with your findings?
1898,I know python and R  but I use python more. For data wrangling I find it superior. You'll find real world data is never ready to be used  so knowing how to make it usable by fixing it up in something like python is a huge skill. Python excels for that.
1899,I'm a highly experience python programmer and I still google things at least once every hour. No one remembers everything  and it's output rather than process which is important. What might change is what you are googling. A lot of what I'm typically looking up is to check library documentation. Sometimes I can't think of the best way to do something with a library  but I trust that someone on stack overflow will know. Occasionally that someone is myself from the past! Sometimes it's other things  like the name of a dunder  or some operator precedence. If you're looking up something like how to write loops  then that would be a concern. Otherwise don't worry.
1900,My trick is to remember I’m not competing with other gms at all... but even if I were  I am sure not competing against the imaginary best possible GM that could ever exist.   Even so  any time a finish a session thinking “that could have been way better” but the players say good things  I realize I was trying to compete with that Mythical Best GM again.  I will say that 2 sessions a week is a lot of stress in itself  especially with games that require a lot of prep. And IMO over prepping just risks making one more anxious  because if you’re not careful you can forget  and go back to aiming for Mythical Best GM level of prep  which again  doesn’t exist.  You’re possibly wound up about the things you’re not doing  or don’t think you’re doing well. Your players are commenting about the things you ARE doing well. Maybe ask them what they liked  and keep doing that.
1901,I’ll watch anything if it’s not romance or anything annoying. I haven’t found any good anime’s recently. So can someone please give some suggestions. Dragon ball  Naruto  Death note  Attack on Titan  Promised Never land  Dr Stone  Akame ga kill Vinland Saga  Full Alchemist BrotherHood  Grand Blue  One piece  One punch man  Fairy tail  Jojo  Black Clover Food wars   Bleach  Tokyo Ghoul  My hero academia  Demon slayer  Gintama  Fate Night  Fire Force  Prison school  Millionare Detective  Re life  91 days Run with the wind   Norogami Code Geass  Stein gates  Kinos journey  Norogami  Run with the wind  Jujutsu Kaisen Yu Yu Yakusho
1902,I know this has been asked before  but with new games coming out all the time  this might get different answers than the same question asked several months ago  which is what I'm hoping for.   My girlfriend and I *love* RPGs. It's one of our favorite hobbies to do together  but with covid and some other personal stuff  getting a group together has become next to impossible. I am fully aware that finding a game online is possible  but I have an extremely erratic work schedule. It would be very difficult to plan consistent sessions with a group and I don't want to make anyone have to deal with that  you know?  Anyways the point is that the best option would be a game we could play 1-on-1 anytime we're together. We've tried it with other games  like 5e  to varying degrees of success. It worked will enough for me to think a game with solid mechanics for a small number of players could be great.   The only real stipulation is that it has to be fantasy. Or  at least  not sci-fi. It's the only thing she hates. Something we could use to go on fantastic adventures with that works well with a DM and 1 player is my dream right now. I've already considered Dungeon World  and while I do think it could work  I want to make sure I'm considering all of my options here.   Thanks for helping out  I really appreciate it!

1904,L'Appel de Cthulhu Malleus Monstrorum 7E  Page 27  Closest thing to official that I could find. It is literally The Thing.  Edit: My only advice is to make sure you have players who are into the concept of doing it. Not everybody would be down for a game where you could have to backstab friends.
1905,Excel Saga is well known for it.  FLCL I think is another one.  Haruhi Suzumiya can be one especially if you are game enough to watch in broadcast order.  This is assuming you are not looking for trainwrecks that are just with terrible plots.
1906,GCN executes 64-wide waves on 16-wide SIMDs over 4 cycles. Seemingly  this arrangement will increase the dependent issue latency by 3 cycles vs executing on a 64-wide SIMD.   I know AMD isn't stupid and there must be some benefit to this arrangement  but I can't think of any. Could someone please enlighten me?
1907,We use notebooks to experiment and if chances look good  develop an early PoC.  Most of times we use them to reference as to why we took a decision during model construction (We took this decision because of....  for details look notebook X cell Y link here)  and to be able to refresh our memory as to which steps/methodology we used and why  if something similar needs to be done again  or if some other team wants to retry /refresh / enhance our work.  What im trying to say  is we store them for read-only archival reasons.  Under that case:  * Create folder in git with project name. * Each iteration  new folder (under the original project folder). * Each iteration folder contains the notebook  link to data used (we have petabytes of storage  so we pull the data we need for the experiment and store... then provide link to the data of each experiment so we can reproduce any time needed - even if DB goes down or w/e....)  and the journal  for that specific iteration. If new libraries were built  wheel file as well. * Overall journal at the root folder of the project. * Once everyone likes latest results  park it there and start working on prod code (ofc on a different git).  We dont do too many projects in my small team (1-2 persons team)  so single repo.
1908,Monday Night Dungeon Dive. Dungeons are endlessly refilling with monsters and dungeon diving is a magically televised competitive sport. The DM is the announcer and there’s always another team trying to beat you to the end of the dungeon (and probably run interference against you in the mean time). You compete for fame  prizes  and merchant sponsorships.   Think Blitzball + Monday Night Combat.
1909,We do not have a 1x8c vs 2x4c example. However we do have a 1x4c and 2x2c example in the 3300x vs 3100  they have the same total core  cache  tdp  and only differ in clock speed and core layout the important part). Reviews place the 3300x around 10-15% faster in single-threaded and multi-threaded with some games being 30%.  The latency between the two chiplets in the 3100 create the vast majority of the difference between the two. I'd argue that maybe half of that is due to the frequency advantage of the 3300x but the rest is from inter-chip latencies.
1910,I'd definitely be interested in seeing how the results would change if the audio was sourced from a higher quality/better controlled source without expletives censored. Interesting project though. That was a fun read.
1911,I really like that they made the worldbuilding AFTER the plot twist (the Enemies of humanity are actually empowered humans).   The way this is written feels great. I also like the way Nana has to outsmart the Talented  finding out their weaknesses and limits to their power.  The Manga got a lot of hate for some reason  but I think it's very good so far.
1912,I can understand what you are feeling but here is my take on it.   R is easy to start off and do analysis  present plots and get a poc out of way. The pain starts after that  the dependency management is a hell hole in r  unit testing is not really well thought of in r  the future of that poc does not look good.   With python  you can turn that poc into a working MVP which integrates well into your organizations tech stack is not far fetched. Most of the required additional add ons are already there and you have a huge resource pool who can turn that poc into a maintenable solution.   At the end of the day  a poc does not generate revenue. A working MVP which you can integrate and iterate over does.   We have a project that started from a poc based on r and the amount of wrappers and duct tape we had to put around that is just nuts. Convincing the team to move to python where we have experienced software engineering support just made the teams life easier.   There is an interesting stat that more than 80 percent of ds poc does not turn into production tools  the tech stack that the data scientists use has a huge say in that.
1913,I want to add that even with motorcycles if you call their corporate line they will also search your vin to see if there’s any open recalls and if any work had been done on the vehicle. Turns out I didn’t know about my motorcycle being recalled in 2016 a year before I owned it and luckily they had already completed it.
1914,I dont know a while lot about the bronco so im not sure if it would actually be suitable for these purposes. All these commercials are staged so dont expect to be able to do 80km/h through a field without it being absurdly rough. In my experience a body on frame jeep like a TJ or XJ is good at this stuff and most trucks as well. Trucks also give you the option of towing ATVs  SxS  boats  trailers  and tons more.
1915,### [The Clockwork Plot](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/326093/Age-of-Ambition-The-Clockwork-Plot)  When the party is hired to break into an unhinged engineer’s laboratory  they stumble upon a criminal undertaking  an arcane secret and the ire of an ambitious Thieves’ Guild lieutenant.
1916,Just interested  how is different available list of fuel  compared to Russia motherland? Do u still have 92  or even 80? Can it be used in anything +-modern? Since here  in Russia  some gas stations has very bad quality gas  that leads to closer engine overhauling.  Do you differentiate 95 and 95 EURO? Is diesel allowed and CHEAPER than gas?
1917,I have an interview with a company that rolls aluminium for the newspaper and magazine industry  i.e. the printing press. They make the aluminium slabs and through a process of heating and cooling it  roll it into a thin sheet of aluminium ready to be rolled similar to tin foil. The question is more around what sort of analysis in regard to process and quality is best for this sort of thing. Previously I have come from a HR/marketing background  so I'd be interested if anyone has had any sort of experience doing data analysis in manufacturing  specifically around process and quality improvement.
1918,With questions like that  it would be better if you were more specific about the goals of these analyses  because both tools have their strengths and weaknesses.  R is really good in doing any data science  is way more popular than SAS  has much more packages and solutions ready to find on the internet. Working with it is much easier than with SAS. However  it's only a data processing language  and not a database for instance. Which means  it needs to be supported with other tools if you analyse bigger amounts of data (gigabytes for example). With most popular databases it integrates easily.  SAS has a lot of classical statistical methods implemented  but is rather terrible as a language. Programming anything non-standard  or even just some basic control flow in it  is really a pain. However  on the plus side  it's a complete system  with both analytics and data storage.  I generally recommend R over SAS any time  unless for some reason you are forced to use SAS (but then you wouldn't ask the question  right?).
1919,Still don’t know why people are rushing to get one.
1920,"This Sunday I was fortunate enough to drive a M2 Competition  back to back  with my 981 Cayman GT4 around the Hockenheim ring. I did 15min in the GT4 and then another 15min in M2C which amounts to 6 laps launched laps with each car. M2C had Michelin Cup 2 tires with M4 sizing  255 front and 275 rear. Relevant extras are the M-Performance Brakes (410mm front  380mm rear)  M-Performance adjustable suspension  upgraded braided brake lines  brake fluid  and Endless MX72 (don't buy this for the racetrack !!!). The car also has a catback akrapovic titanium exhaust but this does nothing for performance.  Here's my honest review about the M2 Competition:   Cockpit and Inputs:  Very good driving position  the seat has lots of adjustments. The lateral support could be better. During turns I found myself wishing for the GT4's bucket seats and 6 points harness. The shifter is in an extremely intuitive position  and at an ideal distance from the steering wheel. Which I think is a bit too ""fat""  a theme in today's bmws  and I would have liked it better if it had a thinner rim. The pedals are well positioned. The clutch is extremely light compared to the GT4  but since you use it like an on/off switch on the racetrack it didn't make a difference. The brakes on the M2C have a lot of assistance  making them much lighter than those of the GT4  this took some time getting used to.   Engine:  It is a powerhouse and responds exemplarily to accelerator inputs. It's amazing the feeling you get when you hit a straight line  change from 3rd to 4th  and the car seems to accelerate faster in 4th than what it did approaching the redline in 3rd. I had already had this feeling in a N54 335i and is an extremely positive note for the BMW turbo engines. A different experience than the atmospheric engines  but for sure more effective than the 3.8 liter boxer in the GT4. The only downside is some loss of emotion and noise.   Gearbox:  Good ratios that allow you to explore the engine without any hassles. The shifter throw between the different gears is on point and has a very satisfactory drive. I believe it to be in line with other BMW manual gearboxes. The accuracy of each gear's gate is good  but it is not at the GT4's level. In the latter  when driving on a circuit  it is easier to ""put them in with conviction"". While pushing the M2  it happened a couple of times when downshifting from 3rd to 2nd  hard on the brakes before turning in  that the second gear did not want to enter right away.   Braking:  The owner of this particular M2 Competition has been having problems with his brake pads which were evident from the start. Some vibrations were felt during hard braking without them affecting the braking power. I would definitely not recommend using Endless MX72 brake pads on anything besides the street  the pads still have a lot of material left in them  but after you bring them above a certain temperature threshold they are only good in the trash bin. After getting used to the c"
1921,Sure  a bank loan is just a check (which you'll have to pay them back for  later). They can make that check out to your friend ('s bank). And then that bank is paid  they'll sign over the title to your bank. You can now insure and register the car.  First sit yourself down and make sure it's actually a good price  and you actually want it.
1922,There’s a couple of good GDC talks on pitching your game that might be quite helpful. You can find these on YouTube. I’m still early stages of my first serious game so can’t offer any sound advice  but the talks are helpful in giving you insight into the various aspects of game dev from seasoned professionals.
1923,Honestly I ended up in data science almost by accident.  I'm a geologist  but I always like programming  did a few undergraduate research projects and an internship in digital signal processing applied to seismic data during undegrad.  After that I started a masters in reservoir geostatistics  started using machine learning to classify reservoir zones of interest. MEanwhile I also dabbled a bit with deep learning applied to fault detection in seismic data.  When I left grad school I couldn't find jobs as a geologist  started applying to data science roles since I already had the skills  got a few offers.  Now I work as an ML researcher for a geophysics company  so it kinda worked out.
1924,They're bringing people who actually ship games.   Tbh  all the organisation changes seem reasonable.   The original leads and directors seemed to go nowhere and bring chaos  now they fix it.   Will it risk changing the authentic original vision for the game? Yes   but we didn't play it  so who knows if it was good in the first place?
1925,As one that use GPUs for video editing more that I do gaming I'm still waiting for reviews for that niche. Included 3090 for its increased VRAM. Puget Systems has the best reviews for that. I see Igor's Lab has a limited benchmark on that thas shows very promessing results.
1926,For how clean the card looks on the outside that was actually pretty easy to disassemble. I just can't help but wonder why they went for fewer thicker fins on this design  seems like it'll be much less efficient at moving heat no matter how stylish they seem.
1927,*80 employees as Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer / you name it. There is no real differentiation.*   Maybe not for you  but in the real world  there abso-fucking-lutely is...   Also  LMAO at your columnar storage wrapper romance. Pivot tables is not what data engineers do NOR do data scientists.
1928,VW would have done much better acquiring SAAB and simply branding what is their Skoda models as SAABs. That way they would have had market penetration in North America  with an existing well known brand.  VW through its Scania subsidiary owns the SAAB Gripen trademark logo  and could acquire the name easily.
1929,"The short of it  as far as I understood: it's a frame rate limiter that dynamically changes to match CPU frametimes to GPU frametimes more or less exactly. If the CPU is much faster than the GPU  the render queue piles up.  You can get the lower latency with a frame rate limiter (i.e.  prevent the GPU from 100% load  where latency rapidly increases)  except you're stuck at that one frame rate. With Reflex SDK (that developers ***must*** incorporate into the game)  the driver adjusts the frame rate limit up and down depending on your GPU / CPU frametimes so that the GPU is **as close to 100%** but does not actually hit 100% utilization. Any ordinary frame rate limiter requires you to configure & find that optimal number and then you're stuck at that single framerate throughout the entire game.  In other words  the Reflex SDK auto-calculates the highest framerate possible while ensuring the GPU load pot doesn't boil over to 100% load (where 100% load can thus ""randomly"" increase your latency). A comparison:  * **Nothing:** any framerate  no configuration -> average latency (e.g.  any time you hit 100% GPU load will increase latency) * **A frame rate limiter:** one framerate  manually configured per game / settings / hardware -> lower  latency * **NVIDIA Reflex:** dynamic framerates  automatically configured -> lower latency  Unfortunate that this is proprietary  while we appreciate the innovation and it's quite useful  requiring game developers to add features to only one GPU vendor isn't ideal.  Two caveats: after validating NVIDIA's latency tool (just like GN did)  that was used to calculate the measurements. Tests were **not** on an RTX 3080  but a good ole GTX 1080 (Reflex works as far back as the 900 series).  That's what I understood  happy to be corrected on anything here."
1930,Id recommend watching the video if you have any desire to buy one of these cards and also support GN.  But the TLDW is overclocking was disappointing on all the tested cards  tested at stock vbios and cooler  with fan speed at 100%  and power limits max. The FTW3 edges out the crown with 3x8 power connectors  but with the vbios limits its negligible. Expect single digit to up to 10% at best performance gains. Basically at this point unless you plan to do mods  buy a card for its warranty/aesthetics/noise  not overclocking potential. Maybe that will change with more premium cards and new vbios'  but thats not the case for those tested/right now.
1931,I'm personally a fan of SUPERS! Revised Edition. It's pretty rules-light and narrative-focused  and it exclusively uses pools of six-sided dice. It scales really well for whatever style of supers you want to play. On the low end  you have pulp heroes like The Shadow and Doc Savage  and on the high end you have cosmic level heroes like Silver Surfer and Green Lantern.  If you go to the official forum  you can find conversions of popular characters from DC and Marvel comics.  https://superscbr.proboards.com/
1932,The more the better.  Some idiots think that programming = language syntax and memorizing the libraries. That's just stupid.  The more exposure you have to different languages (Java  C#  Kotlin  Go  Rust  C  C++  Swift  Python  Javascript  Typescript  Haskell  Scala. Clojure  Erlang...) the more you'll be able to see the strengths and differences between different languages and be able to take lessons learned from one language (and it's standard way of doing things and the culture) to another language.  It's like the difference between being born and raised in the US/UK and learning 1 language and literally not being able to comprehend that other people might think in other languages than English vs. being born and raised in mainland Europe and learning 4 languages by the time you are 6 years old.  When you're exposed to a bunch of languages  a new language will never be a problem for you anymore. You can literally start a new project with a brand new language and brand new frameworks and get work done at a good pace and be very proficient with it in a very short amount of time. Like it is not even a consideration whether you know language X  it literally doesn't matter if you're worked with it for 10 years or if you're seeing it for the first time.
1933,The all hybrid powertrain lineup (and a 2.5L I4 engine no less and utter lack of a v6) is a very ambitious plan from Toyota  though that 36mpg number on something this big and spacious is nothing short of incredible.   I think the styling is pretty unique  and the kick sliding doors is a unique proposition  even if i dislike Toyota/Lexus kick sensors with a passion.   There is a lot of criticism of the fixed 2nd row seats  though i suspect that this is mainly going to sell towards extended families moreso than skilled trades.
1934,A lot of their most big name adaptations in the last 10 or so years are pretty notoriously bad  most notably Tokyo Ghoul  there're also Kingdom and Sousei no Onmyouji  they also don't produce as many anime titles as most studios do since they do quite a few long running series  so there aren't many good ones  really  the only notably good ones I can think of made by them in the past few years are Akatsuki no Yona and Baby Steps.
1935,As a hiring manager  I would put both of those titles on the same category  i.e.  I'm not ruling someone out of an MLE role just because they were previously a DS  and I'm not ruling someone out of a DS role because they were previously an MLE.  If we were talking about the difference between Data Analyst and DS/MLE  or the difference between Software Developer and DS/MLE - sure  that matters. And that is because those job titles are much more established  so a lot of hiring managers will assume that they are certainly not DS/MLE.  But in the current stage that we're in  we know that anything that sounds like DS is in the DS umbrella  and you're going to have to do your due diligence when evaluating resumes beyond titles.
1936,My experience is based on playing (but not running) SWN 1e  Spears of the Dawn  Other Dust  and Silent Legions  but the answer is that combining them was trivial  It shouldn't be hard to fight a naval battle against Cthulhu in Silent Legions using the Starship rules from SWN. Running TL 0 folks in Other Dust by using the Spears of the Dawn rules should similarly be easy. Taking equipment rules from Other Dust and using it to represent your gear falling apart in a survival-horror Silent Legions context should be easy. And applying the SWN faction system to literally anything but especially Sine Nomine's sandbox games takes essentially no extra work. All you have to do is change the names of the units
1937,I am in no way an expert but VW bus enthusiast go for more windows.  More windows = more collectible value.  Of course there are probably many more little things that I don't know but it's the same with any collectible  certain features and rarity are more treasured.
1938,I sure BMW would kill 8 series again soon. Since they withdraw r/WEC M8 GTE effort  they only barely race r/USCR.   Many sedan based coupes are going to disappear. Unfortunately  8-series is one of these models.
1939,"Seems to me that you're going to have to ask your designer *why* they want to know. What are they going to do with this information? Until you understand the problem that you're trying to solve  you won't know the right way to implement ""test if two units are moving toward each other""."
1940,*A Tomino Fan Rewatches Xabungle Episode 2:*  - Infodump! Apparently the name of this planet is Zora  although people have forgotten that name. There’s only a few pockets of civilization on the planet  which just seems to be composed of entirely deserts. What a lovely place to live.  - It seems like Elchi has taken quite an interest in Jiron there. First Rag  and now Elchi. Jiron has quite the magnetic personality  it seems.  - As Elchi nearly demonstrates on Jiron again  she’s quite handy with a knife. You know  considering how Cosmo Yuki from Space Runaway Ideon was also handy with a knife  I wonder if Tomino just really liked that character trope during 1980-1982.  - And now for a bit more character stuff from Jiron  apparently his father was a well-known Rockman [(not that Rockman)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Mega_Man_%28Mega_Man_9%29.png) called the “Arms of Steel”. I suppose that’s where Jiron gets his tenacity from in the first place.  - We’re getting a bit of a better idea of how ruthless people are on Zora. Carrying Cargo is authorizing raids on independent Breakers to steal their stuff  and that’s apparently how he managed to afford the purchase of the *Iron Gear* from a group called the Innocent. Worldbuilding!  - Speaking of  the *Iron Gear* can transform into a massive upright mech  but apparently it’s hard to make the transformation actually happen. Yeah  of course a landship would have a hard time turning into a mech. Did you see the size of the thrusters needed to start the transformation in the first place? That’s a lot of weight to lift.  - Well  things haven’t gone well  and Cargo’s men have completely raided the Breaker group Jiron joined up with. Although really  Jiron held his ground well with that rocket launcher. Alas  he forgot about mankind’s oldest enemy: Gravity. Always keep an eye out for falling rocks  folks.  - Elchi continues to be a rather picky princess type. Just admit that you like Jiron and give him a lift  instead of just flying off in the Xabungle.  - And there’s another bit of reality ensuing: Jiron has *zero fucking idea* of how to ride a motorcycle. Although to be fair to him  most motorcycles have two wheels  not one big one.  - Jiron has mastered the stealth of just acting like you belong. By hiding in the smoke kicked up by the Sand Rats on the *Iron Gear’s* deck  Kotsett thinks that Jiron is a member of the maintenance crew and gives him a gun. Jiron wins by doing absolutely nothing.  - Long-time Gundam fans have noted the poor security present in Tomino’s series  but at least here in Xabungle giant mechs can’t just be immediately stolen out of the repair bay. Instead  Rag and Jiron have to hotwire the mech  which is just a funny statement when you think about it.  - Reality continues to ensue even more when it’s apparent that Jiron has very little idea of what he’s actually doing when piloting the Xabungle. Even if he’s gotten the hang of moving it around  he still has a hard time
1941,[The Ryzen 3 3200G is a first tier gaming CPU ](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy 4312.html) but you have forgotten to include a few details.  What is your budget and screen resolution and how many frames per second are you expecting in most games?  Video cards are purchased to match those metrics.
1942,Hello guys  I am a 20 year old 2nd year civil engineering student and I aspire to be a data scientist one day. I am currently working towards my dream by getting certificates and specializations in coursera  learning python and other languages  etc. After I finish my bachelors  Im hoping to take masters in data science here in our country.  I have heard of lean six sigma for quite a long time and I know that it also uses data and it can increase the efficiency of a company. I am planning to get the green belt before I finish my bachelors. Do you think that it can help me in the future? Is lean six sigma connected to data science at all? Thank you very much and have a great day!
1943,1. Branding helps a lot. Give everything a silly snazzy name  some retarded acronym or something memorable. 2. Make it transparent and available to everyone  host your stuff on the intranet. If it's just an API serving predictions let's say  create an info page with some cool graphs and shit explaining how it all works  in relative layman's terms. Animate it if possible! 3. Always create a frontend / dashboard for your projects. Even if it's just a Flink dashboard showing uptime  a count of predictions served etc. Give people something to look at and talk about! Numbers for the sake of numbers  corporate bitches love that. 4. Enable discoverability of all of the above in your organization and make sure your name features somewhere at the top. This is your Conlfuence pages  company wiki  w/e you guys use. If you use a Slack dictionary or something  put an entry there for your <snazzily\_named> tool. 5. Last and probably most important of all  get your manager to shout about this from the rooftops. If he/she is not doing that for you  understand why it's not happening and consider moving internally / externally to work with someone that understands how to promote your success. If you don't have it in you  you don't. I'm an introvert too and while I'll as bluntly speak my mind in a meeting room with the CEO as I am speaking it up here on reddit  I will never shamelessly go about self-promoting my work. I hardly have a constructive way to accept praise about it  much less promote it.  Just my humble opinions from my experience in the field.   P.S. 1 more thought. There is a chance your organization doesn't value what you bring to the table (blame them for their own stupidity). Big old-school corporate is really good at promoting their own  playing politics all day etc. If your assessment is that that's the case  get up and leave.   My 2c  hope this gives you a few ideas :)
1944,Could they? Yes.  I suspect though Nvidia is making far longer plays than this.  Outwardly  their ARM buy was much more of a datacenter play. ARM CPUs in a GPU based High-performance Compute (HPC) system would allow them to dominate the data center. This makes them a far greater threat to Intel than they are to AMD (though they would be a threat to AMD's efforts to break into the data center).  &#x200B   I personally think if there is any play on personal computers  it will be more through thin client cloud solutions. Essentially moving away from processing on the device into processing on the cloud. Widespread broadband internet and 5G will allow computing to be more seemless and less segmented.
1945,While I agree the headphone Jack should be removed from phones/tablets  I don’t agree with removing it from PC/laptops. It’s used enough in these environments that removing it for a single makes no sense.
1946,They fit better as American cartoons/animation. I loved all the batman animated movies and the spectacular Spider-man series was amazing.  I honestly don't think I could see these series as Japanese anime though. After watching things like the Avengers anime and the Batman Ninja movie  American superheroes really don't fit imo.
1947,Yea  a lot of GMs believe that challenge comes only from combat.  My games are very challenging  but combat is usually a breeze.  The challenge comes from role-playing  figuring things out  making difficult choices  picking a side  and challenging circumstances.    It does depend on the game  I play a lot of Aftermath! and if combat is challenging  player characters end up dying.  That just isn't fun nor challenging.  In our last game  they were pit fighting for money and came out of one fight with a guy with a broken hand and a girl with a broken foot.  Plus  the girl accidentally one punched a guy to death with a critical hit in a non-lethal fight.  That was a bad fight.  So yes  you have to earn your victories  but if that method is just fighting difficult monsters  then the challenge is to throw enough dice  nothing more.
1948,I am going against the grain here  from what I have seen applying to jobs and people applying to my company  it has 0 importance. Sure on paper it sounds cool  but in the end  no one actually cares  no one will bother looking  and you won't be asked about it. Even when you are lacking in experience.
1949,I know two data scientists who are college dropouts. They both did an in-person datascience bootcamp. Don't know much more of their story  but they were both pretty strong coders before they joined the bootcamp. By strong coders I mean they would participate in online coding contests and be close to the top.     I am not a fan of Kaggle  and don't personally know anyone who is. My company would definitely not hire anyone who only has done Kaggle problems.
1950,I went from a silver 2006 Subaru Outback to a Nitrous Blue 2018 Ford Focus RS and honestly the attention I get is much more noticeable. The Outback was essentially invisible  I could drive well over the speed limit right past cops and they wouldn't do a thing  but I've already had a cop pull a U turn and pace my speed in the Focus RS just because I had the exhaust in sport mode so it was a little loud.
1951,I used a naive bayes classifier for categorising advertising content for my final year project in my undergraduate but I am not beginning a MSc in Data Science. When I was developing the algorithm I never really paid much attention to resource usage(I have a fairly decent gaming PC so performance wasn't really noticeable). Also it was developed in JS.  I am curious how resource allocation is handled in these types of workloads  does the IDE/code editor assign them or are you guys using different tools to run the algorithms in? Basically trying to prepare myself before starting and this was one simple question I couldn't find a solution for.
1952,These would sell super well  by which I mean please sell me some. Throw in some potion-looking bottles from Michael's to put the drinks in? Or even better  vintage bottles? I will mail you my wallet in exchange.
1953,"I don't mind the mid grade performance badged cars. Things like the Mercedes C43  BMW M340  etc etc. But the ""line"" trim levels that a little more than a performance package  those are the ones I do not like. It confuses the buyer. My friend's wife drive an Audi A4 with S-line package. She says that she drives an S4."
1954,Most American muscle buyers care V8 engine  not tracking and handling. You can understand why GM offering non SS LT1 Camaro.   Current Camaro also suffers looking issue  and it also suffers poor visibility  poor rear seat  and poor cargo. It has best chassis to compare Mustang and Challenger  but it isn’t really good for daily drive.
1955,I was just watching YouTube when my laptop started sounding like a dirt bike cranking up. I don't know what to do. It's an ASUS gaming laptop if that helps. I turned it off and then turned it back on but it keeps doing it. I haven't even had it for year.
1956,I thought it was quite fun  and funny too. And I have no idea what you folks are on about with the talk of bad voice acting either. Mafuyu's VA was clearly channeling her inner Konata even outside of her doomed impression bit which was delightful  and the rest were just standard at worst.  Really liked the quick rapport and chemistry between the lead duo too  even if the B couple look like more fun. Definitely leans more towards SoL seasoned with light drama than I initially expected from such a Lucky Star-adjacent production but I'm absolutely on board. In love with these character designs too  calling back to the past decade in a refreshing way.
1957,emulation especially for the aging lasers in the original Xbox are a reason i love Xbox. i do not own an Xbox because i play everything on pc   ps1 ps2 but currently with the Sony's censorship in some games and disliking the game shop i still see no need to buy a ps5 compared to Xbox. i can wait with a purchase until scarcity and prices drop and good exclusives come out
1958,Have a look at [Spire](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/spire-rpg/) and [Heart](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/heart-the-city-beneath-rpg/)  the mechanics are very simple (D10 dice pool  keep highest) and the play is very narrative and freeform. Also the settings and character classes are excellent.

1960,I thought OLED was already better than mLED  other than maybe burn in. And it's already available. Or is micro LED new?  Edit: I was confusing tech & wrong  sorry. But now I still need to lookup what makes microLED amazing (over mini- and O-)
1961,why is the thread up this late?  Anyways  this seems like a serious Episode. Blood trafficers would be stupid  blood isn't worth that much IRL  at least not enough to kill a person for it. Is it different in that world or is the readhead just an airhead?
1962,"Are you talking Hunger Games style?  If you're talking about an ""everyone is thrown in but only one can walk away"" type ""tournament"" this is what your looking at.  This level of PvP isn't something I'd be especially interested in playing except maybe as a solo game.  The other way I see it running would essentially be bunch of head to head challenges where a ""winner"" would be picked each round to advance to the next match up.  It's use your typical ""tournament tree"" and could even be double elimination assuming the challenges aren't lethal."
1963,You’ll be fine bro relax  I’m almost 200 percent sure it’s fine since it’s the one time  it’s not gonna break that easy unless you do it hella more it’s metal it won’t break that easy no need to worry yet
1964,Well I would imagine the deposits on my brake rotors make my car feel a specific way  though that wouldn't be a positive descriptor. I do like how my Civic still has an almost Vtec like jump once it hits 5k rpm even though the D17a1 doesn't have V-Tec
1965,You want to Google experiment tracking  e.g. https://neptune.ai/blog/best-ml-experiment-tracking-tools  I have heard good things about Weights & Biased  but I don't have a personal experience. You can check the link above to see some other options.
1966,Fab engineer here. Here's just one pretend example  but it's the general concept:  Let's say I'm making an oxide film. I want the film to be as thin as possible (for best performance)  but it can't have any holes in it  because if it does  then you get a short between  say  your gate and your drain  and the transistor is dead.  Early on in the technology  the variability in my film thickness is  say  +/-5 A. So I set the target at 7 A  that way all my films will be between 2 and 12 nm. But the engineers know this is an issue  so they work on finding ways to make the film more uniform. Eventually they get it down to +/- 3 A. So now we can retarget our average thickness from 7 A to 5 A  and get a performance boost out of that.

1968,How strong is your data engineering and Python/Programming? If it’s very strong you can just go down the route of ML engineers.   If you’re still more inclined on data science then moving towards a 2nd job in a more senior DS  find a org that you know values data science  but this involves understanding math. Eventually when you run your own data science org chart it’s more about understanding the business then getting the right team together to solve these problems.  If you’re saying 2nd job into strategy/management /leadership then Start off with data science or product analytics (FANG structure)  then begin shifting over to PM related
1969,Renault Clio V6...went through a big hot hatch phase  and the clio’s were my favourite...and the V6 is the special king daddy fantasy clio  I mean it would probably be slower than most of the higher end 2 litre cars  but it’s cooler
1970,Fully synchronized box I find double clutch will let me smoothly back into 1st at a higher speed  that's it.  So rev match yes  downshift yes  double clutch if you need to  don't overthink things - you don't want your car to outlive you.  Rarely have I sold anything completely wore out...
1971,GR Yaris has entered the chat... Actually in Japan there are multiple examples of exactly what you want  there is an RC trim of the GRY which has less weight and no expensive infotainment  HUD etc. and is significantly cheaper.  They did the same with the 86 when it was released. Maybe there’s less profit in those models going overseas?
1972,I've got two RPG's on my reading list at the moment.  The first is Forbidden Lands.  I uh...in a weak moment picked up the entire line of books.  My wallet wants to kill me  but I don't regret the decision.  These are some beautiful books and the game itself reads and looks to play great.  The big eye opener is how they design adventure sites.  Was another of those epiphany moments that completely changes how I prep campaigns.  I'm absolutely in love with this system and I can't wait to start running adventures in these settings.  Secondly  [Against the Darkmaster](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329319/Against-the-Darkmaster-Core-Rules).  It's essentially a modernized retroclone of Middle-Earth Roleplaying  but setting agnostic.  I've pretty much instantly fallen in love with it.  The world building tools  the tools for the GM the book provides for creating big bads and so much more in this game just feels like it was practically made just for me.  I can't wait to get this to the table.
1973,Order a paint pen from Toyota. One side of the paint pen should be abrasive like sandpaper. Scratch the rust out of the spot  carefully. Then fill in with paint pen to seal it up. They can get your exact paint code from the vin number.
1974,Higurashi was great imo  You said that your journey looking for a dark “fantasy” continued so I guessed that’s another reason why you don’t like higurashi because it wasn’t fantasy  Kai was better as it explains all the loops. Maybe higurashi just wasn’t your type of thing. You can drop it but that would be a waste.   You don’t have to push yourself through the whole thing. If you don’t like it then feel free to drop it
1975,Honestly this is one of my favourite new shows of the season and I did not see that coming.  The chemistry  action and characters make the episodes just fly by. Love how everyone participates in the fights as well.

1977,I’ve got a 2013 Honda Pilot and the AC seems to be working infrequently. I don’t know what the deal is  but sometimes I hop in and AC blows ice cold. Other times  it seems weaker than normal  and other times it’s not working at all. I don’t know the rhyme or reason behind it. I’ve checked the area near the windshield for any obstructions that might be fucking up the AC but it was clear. I don’t think it needs a recharge  but maybe I’m wrong. Any ideas?
1978,Hi guys    Could you guys rate the usefulness of this article for a data science beginner:  [Mindful Data Wrangling](https://medium.com/@sparkplugslug19/mindful-data-wrangling-1029df0a2dd1?source=friends_link&sk=aec162ff15dbd999f3f537bdff9c7165)
1979,Considerably better animation and art this week than last. I know it’s gonna be 60+ eps so quality is gonna vary  but man that was bad last week. This week was a really good episode and man that reveal at the end was wild. So Takeru’s been kidnapped and the gang’s split up. Can’t wait for next week.
1980,You don't need to use neutral gear when you come to a stop with a dct  you can just leave it in drive and treat it like a regular automatic. Also  if you're in 3rd and you start slowing down the car will eventually downshift for you. A fair amount of cars will also upshift for you even in manual mode when you hit redline even.
1981,The games was fun but does lack that certain something that puts it all toghther. I feel spider is getting closer to what they really want to make with their outlandish themes and settings  which not alot of big developers are doing (just going for it) . IMO
1982,Yes. I work for one of those companies that produces an AI that plugs in as a library and solves a problem set that usually requires a team of DS folks. (Entity resolution) I'd say looking at the industry overall we are somewhere in the early onset of productized generally deployable ML/AI under APIs and in libs so intelligent product development will be more focused on using plug and play parts.  However  don't underestimate the value of skills and experience that allows you to work directly on those types of products.  I just see the specialized roles becoming less in the corporation and more in specific product companies / organizations.
1983,I just ended episode 3 and i honestly can't watch the rest  it's making me too damn emotional. Like  that guy literally kills everything and everyone without exceptions  doesn't care about anything  i just can't continue this. Is there an anime that you stopped watching for a similar reason?
1984,Hey  adventurers! I'm a longtime D&D player turned busy father. I just don't have time for gaming sessions any more though  so I created D20 Go. It's based on older versions of D&D  but streamlined for asynchronous play-by-post or fast tabletop play. And it's SUPER easy for new players.  Check it out at https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330947/D20-Go or on Discord at https://discord.gg/YSkepNa
1985,Between Game  Narrative  Simulation and Emotion  I prefer Narrative with a bit of Game thrown in. But I've wandered all over the place. I started out firmly in the Narrative camp  and viewed the Game as helping me get to the story. For a while  in college  I was all about Simulation.  I don't really get Emotion well enough to enjoy it  but I'll always make time for any combination of the other three.
1986,They usually are developing the analytics strategy for a department or company.  So high level decisions from the team r&d.  And continuous improvement. Also helping some in data analysis stories.  It is all geared toward the business needs.
1987,Depends a lot on what you count as Data Scientist.  Head of DS at my company is $1-2M. Pretty common for Director/Sr. Dir/ VP of DS or ML at large tech companies to be in low to mid 7 figures.  The most senior ML ICs in tech should clear $1M. I know a few. A lot of people with $1M target compensation in tech are in practice a lot higher due to stock appreciation in the sector.   I'm suspicious of your uncle's story. Wouldn't surprise me that DS in game companies make $1M  but not for doing what he said.
1988,I'm terrible with maths and my short term memory is shot to shit. So I fumble a lot  all the time even. I actually have really low self esteem about GMing because of it. But I feel confident that my skills in being adaptive  world building  giving player agency  description etc make up for the mechanical flubs.
1989,Hi data science community!  I may have an opportunity for my employer to sponsor a master program in data science. I thought I’d ask your help on navigating the different programs out there and determining my best fit. I’m sure there are plenty of posts about programs but I was hoping some added background information on myself would potentially fine tune any advice.  Background on me: I am in data/market analytics  mostly in the building products manufacturer space in the US. I have almost 5 years experience in market research and almost 3 years experience in more general market analytics  mapping sales to economic data series  monitoring trends and using simple statistics to forecast one period out. I have a bachelors in marketing and have self taught some python programming skills (mostly using Jupyter notebooks)   as well as very light SAS software experience. I did not have a strong formal education in stats but I’m driven  and very eager to learn.   I’d appreciate any guidance or advice on things to look for in a program! Thanks!  **on mobile so please forgive any odd formatting
1990,Power is wasted being transferred along the drive line and axles.  The old joke:  some car companies are looking at the pros and cons of rear wheel drive  with a front mounted engine.  Loosing 30% of power output from the engine to move the drive line  so another manufacturer says that’s unacceptable and just puts the engine in the back (Mid engine cars).  So  if you keep your engine on the axle you want propelling the vehicle you are not sacrificing power.  It’s a proven design  eg Ferrari Lamborghini  Porsche  MR2s  and countless others.    Some of the faster cars coming out now (upcoming C8  and others) have a mid engine petroleum engine and a front mounted electric one.  This lets them break new barriers in the auto racing world.   Tldr: yes  it’s being wasted.  You want power directly on the axle being sent to the tires.  Any component that sits between the engine and driveshaft/wheel robs it of power.
1991,"Yep ""Is the Order a Rabbit?"" is definitely back. Adorable  hilarious and heartwarming like always. God it is just so good to see them again. Thank you Japan for loving this series so much so that the rest of us to get to see them again. It's just so great to see the band back together with their typical back and forth  straight man humor again even if I only started watching this series just under three months ago now.  Also damn is the OP for this once a banger! Probably not #1 for me  that goes to the other absolutely adorable show airing this season Tonikaku Kawaii  but I'm definetly adding it to my anime songs playlist alongside all of the other OP's and ED's from this amazing series."
1992,The main problem is that your average psychologist that knows R will have an extremely narrow set of skills. Employers are more often than not they won't gamble on it. It doesn't matter what YOUR skills are  it matters what the average skills an average PhD in psychology has.  Employers will gamble on CS grads  statistics grads  physics grads etc. because they've demonstrated that they're capable of learning everything a data scientist would need.   You? You're an unknown. It's not that difficult to learn how to make some industry standard plots in R and do some statistical testing by following a step-by-step protocol that is also industry standard for RCT's or whatever. They even have guideline papers that will walk you through what you have to do. And that's what most MD's  psychologists  social scientists etc. do. They'll write on their resume that they are statistical gods and yet don't know how to do matrix multiplication. You can't have a data scientist that can't multiply two matrices.  What I'd recommend for people in your position is to apply for data analyst/BI analyst jobs and work your way up from there. A year at the farm to get that sweet industry job experience and a chance to slap some tensorflow and REST api on the resume. When you have work experience  your education stops mattering.

1994,Dread: instead of dice  you're pulling blocks from a jenga tower. If it falls  your character dies. Great for really intense one-shots. The longer you go without mishaps means that somebody is more and more likely to die  and the actions of other players (making them pull blocks) also bring everybody collectively closer to the end. Never has any other TTRPG system created such an immediate  palpable tension so quickly for me. It's also so simple that it's great for getting people that don't usually play RPGs into the idea.
1995,Mine charged 300 something to do an evap hose. I ended up letting them do it because the dealership was paying so whatever. Didn't bother looking up how difficult it was to do. My CEL came back on for the same issue and I found out I needed to get a hose from an older model for it to work. So I ordered one for $100. You know how long it took me to change the hose? 5 minutes. Zero tools. Just open the hood  disconnect the old one  and put the new one in. Only reason it took even 5 minutes was because one of the connectors was in the back and I had to do it by feel rather than sight.
1996,YESSSSSSSS     I legit hate magic cause it always screws up my worlds. I got this really detailed world made up  with governments  wars  problems and the like then one of my players uses magic. I've always struggled to sort out how to balance that and to watch it all fall apart because some fucking wizard fireballs
1997,"After many revisions and putting the RPG through its paces I have released my rules-light gonzo OSR rpg  *A Crucible For Silver*  here: [https://skyorrichegg.itch.io/a-crucible-for-silver](https://skyorrichegg.itch.io/a-crucible-for-silver) and [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329978/A-Crucible-For-Silver](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329978/A-Crucible-For-Silver) for $4 in a mostly public domain art other than the beautiful cover by John Gagne: [https://www.instagram.com/johngagneart/](https://www.instagram.com/johngagneart/).  Taking inspiration from Knave  Into the Odd  Troika!  Electric Bastionland  and Mausritter  it is a quick and easy to play weird fantasy where the players run a mercenary company similar to the Black Company. 1d100 weird backgrounds  1d100 weird trinkets  2d6 sort-of level-less spells. An inventory system inspired by old computer RPGs where you ""tetris"" the items into a 10 by 10 grid  it is quick  intuitive  and fun. The inventory can be done with papercraft or a free app we developed that is still in alpha.  Edit: If you get the drivethrurpg version of the pdf you can still access the free optional inventory app here: [https://skyorrichegg.itch.io/a-crucible-for-silve](https://skyorrichegg.itch.io/a-crucible-for-silve)"
1998,Such an underrated game by people who couldn't get over the implementation of motion controls.  Some of the most creative items and interesting bosses (except for the repeats) in the series.  And other than the controls  the biggest complaints are probably about Fi's annoying speech and the repeated item pickup messages  which are easily fixed and Nintendo has already show a willingness to go in another direction with in Breath of the Wild.  And as the last standard definition Zelda  it could really benefit from the upgrade to HD.
1999,I’m deploying an enterprise level SVM classification model right now for a big NLP project. I’m not using the SVM implementation though but the Stochastic Gradient Descent version since it’s much faster with large data sets.
2000,McLaren have shared the first pictures of their new hybrid supercar  to be unveiled next year  in camouflage. According to the McLaren Automotive website  the car will feature a new carbon fibre chassis and an all-new hybrid V6 powertrain. On their latest instagram post  the company states the car is all-new and will be the successor to the current Sport Series range  which will end production.     Edit: to clarify  the Sports Series  which in the instagram post has confirmed to be ending production with the start op electrification of the McLaren model lineup from 2021  entails the 540C  570GT  570S  600LT and 620R models.
2001,"I have two laptops that need repairs- wach with its own set of problems. I was thinking about doing self-repair but I feel that I am most likely going to mess things up.   Lenovo Y520 - Screen Broke *1050ti  2tb  512GB(?)SSD Simple as that- I believe it would cost $100~ for a screen with 15.6 inches average  along with a $100 repair fee (Micro Center) - and what not.. I can use it find through and HDMI  its just irksome.  Dell Latitude E7470 - Charger Port Broke I found out today through a tech company that the charge port broke  along with minor water damage to the screen. To get it cleaned would be no cost. For the charger port  though  it is $125  I am wondering necessarily if I should attempt to do some self repair  since it could be good CE experience (my major I will be studying)- or if I should just get it repaired and tank the cost?  Although I may not have necessary tools now  I do know that the uni I go to has a lab designed for tinkering with stuff like that ""currently provides students access to 3D printing  laser cutting  soldering and other utilities to work on small electric and mechanical prototypes."".   First laptop is I believe 2 years  the other I recently got this year refurbished.  Thanks in advance guys."
2002,"Creators of R created the language for statisticians. Creators of Python created the language for everyone.  With python  everything is equally easy. It's designed like lego  you have building blocks you combine to do something. It doesn't really matter what are you doing  the complexity will be similar. It doesn't matter if you're doing webdev  configuring servers  web scraping  writing integration tests  writing signal processing software  writing scientific simulation software. It's all going to about equal.  R is like fully assembled toys. Ready to go out of the box  but you can't really break them apart and make something new with them. You can't really combine them  you can't really modify them etc. It's too rigid.  Learning how to do basically everything in python is easier than learning how to do basically everything in R. Much  much easier.  If you learn python to a level of taking a formal ""introduction to programming"" college level course in it  everything becomes super simple. And I really mean everything. Need to scrape some data? no problem. API for using S3 and databases? no problem. Backend for a webpage? no problem. Some physics simulation to run on a 10 000 core cluster? no problem. Data science? no problem. IoT? no problem. DevOps? no problem.  If you learn Python  Javascript and C++  you can basically do literally everything from programming microcontrollers on sensors to [doing data-driven interactive stories that can get the point across better than any other form of media](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1)  Python can handle 80%-90% of it  so if you know one language then Python would be it.   If you're good at something  it becomes easy. I switched from R to python simply because I didn't see any reason to keep using R except for some rare cases where I need a specific statistical package. In those cases I just transfer some pandas data frames to R to use that one niche package and then get the results back to python and keep going."
2003,WE NEED YOUR HELP said the multi billionaire company that could perfectly buy an entire country without a problem. It's not like an indie company with a group of 10 people that got their project rejected.  By the way  the best part is when they talk about freedom of playing anything on any platform when they've been forcing PC players to play AAA games on their dogshit launcher without another option for the last year and a half.
2004,Have been thinking how Cambrige Analytica used facebook graph DBs to influence elections and drum up public interest amongst particular demographics. Would be great if this was used for a better cause. Not the data science issue one would first think of  but IMO - one of the larger hurdles preventing change is the ability to  enducing swift science based policy and to combat the misinformation campaigns.  There are so many effects of climate change. Farmers in the mid west of USA may not care much about SLR but may be receptive reliable and stable weather patterns. Which data resonate with what demographic? Targeted Truths across social media would be in better hands of data scientist than grubby political entities.
2005,I'd get a book in math with excercises  a pad of paper and a pencil...and have a go going through it.... Don't forget the rubber....you're going to need it..make sure you buy the companion book with answers....  Learning something is awesome  it sucks when you have to work at it. Genuinely  that's the way you'll learn. The moocs are good for understanding the terminology but to be able to do it...you gotta do it .
2006,It's all about the money  but if your vehicle had the column shift available from the factory no doubt you could find a wrecked one in a salvage yard to get the parts for the conversion 👍🤠 Bueña Suerté mi Vato
2007,Hey guys. I am currently about to begin my data science journey. I have been accepted onto a Data Science MSc at my local university (I have a BSc in Biomedical Science and QTS/PGCE). I would like to get as much of a head start on the course as possible  seen as I do not come from a mathematical undergrad (though I did have to collect and process data). There is an absolute wealth of resources out there for me to be getting on with  and I feel a little like a kid in a sweet shop.   I have been practicing my Python pretty rigorously and trying to familiarise myself with the field. I have an intensive coding workshop lined up for the week before my course starts  but if anyone has any specific books or advice to offer  that would be fantastic. Is there a single book you feel in invaluable? Or maybe an eclectic website I am missing out on?   Thanks in advance!

2010,- The Date and Time is Set in Stone  forever. Nothing else promotes both GM and Player sanity more. - I almost never play with IRL friends  I recruit a new group for most every game online and recruit the best players possible via a meticulous recruitment process (the folks in the groups tend to get to be friends in a few sessions anyway!) I wrote a guide to this process [here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/6huyw0/playing_with_strangers_my_guide_to_recruiting/)  - I overload players with information pre-game so that character creation and oboarding goes as smoothly as possible - I speak one-on-one with players during character creation and allow them to chat with one another on the discord server during the character creation period rather than doing a formal session zero.
2011,Can anyone provide an example (or multiple examples) of data transformations/manipulations that they believe are easy/concise in R but not in python?   I’ve used both a decent amount (although certainly more python recently) and haven’t really found any use cases which couldn’t be handled cleanly and concisely in python... I’m wondering if it is just a lack of knowledge of some of the lesser known pandas/numpy methods that trips people up?  EDIT: typo
2012,All info on this topic that I could find so far was rather vague... The MIT article as well. They say that it  > would work to produce a CNFET that could outperform [...]  What does _would work_ mean? It somewhat sounds more like _but doesn't work yet_ to me. I have not really found news about any really interesting (finished) prototypes  it seems more like they're barely achieving basic funtionality. Considering that the first ones were made in 1998  my money would be on 10+ years before we see a mainstream product.
2013,I used to never worry until I hit a baby raccoon and needed $1600 in repairs due to a cracked bumper.  Now I'm constantly paranoid whenever I drive on back roads at night.  I want to replace my G8 with a truck.  Not specifically because of anxiety  but it's definitely a bonus.

2017,I'm trying to install Ubuntu using a bootable pendrive. I used Rufus to create the PD.  The problem is  whenever the system boots into the OS  it works fine for a few minutes and randomly gets completely frozen with a glitched display. Attaching the image in this post. At this point the system is unrecoverable and the only solution is to restart/power off the system physically (using the Restart and Power button in CPU cabinet).  I tried booting/using the OS through pendrive only  but it still gets glitched up. I'm using Windows 10 currently and wanted to dual boot the system. Earlier I suspected it's some hardware issue but since W10 is working all fine  I don't think that's the reason anymore.  Any kind of help would be appreciated. Thank you!  My system configuration:  * Intel Core i3 - 1st Gen * 4 GB DDR3 RAM * 1TB HDD * No external graphic card  https://preview.redd.it/cpgza2z3g2r51.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8acf0b52ba3f12e182e7a37bda52c97a032f7f4d
2018,"It always makes me feel very weird / self-conscious when one of our lower quality videos gets popular  because we're kinda sitting here like  ""wait  no -- you all need to see the stuff we try super hard with! Don't watch this one!""  For anyone who doesn't understand the context  that is 100% believable. Short of it is that I was wrapping up for the week right when this story started getting big. We were in the middle of a livestream (the night before I was planning to leave town for a few days) when the capacitor stuff blew up  and so a lot of people had been asking us what we think. That's really cool and we appreciate that people want to know  so I tried to throw something together quickly for the core audience. I only brought my laptop with me and had a GoPro  so editing capabilities were not great and obviously I wasn't in the same town as my studio equipment  so audio is mixed. Sorry about that. I was expecting this to be a 50K views video for the core audience  so if it's a bit jarring given the biking + talking + audio angle  then I apologize for that!"
2019,Hi datascience!I've been working with data as a BI Developer for the past three years  and after a recent major restructuring change i think it's time for me to move on from my current job. The problem is that my experience seems (to me at least) very niche. I would love advice on what job titles I should be searching under or best skills/certifications to work on to become eligible for what I'm looking for (which I'm not sure).  * I mostly program in R. I do so at an advanced level including packaging and shiny  but my sql  python  etc. is limited. * I don't have any significant job experience with NLP  ML  or related algorithm design. * my BS is in Econ with a math minor. No advanced degree or certifications. * I'm very interested in survey development  form  and data design - in general  how to frame processes to get good data. * I'm good at providing vision and facilitating communication and buy-in from stakeholders - I managed to mostly shift my company's culture from siloed and secretive to data-driven over \~2 years.  I'd like to find a job category that fits my talents and pays 80k+ or one that I could use as a stepping stone to a higher position.
2020,Both the miata and the brz twins are the same way. They're meant to a low powered fun sports car that handles well before power. The reason more people complain about the twins is because it's owned by younger people more than older. I don't think either should get boosted from factory both are fine in their application. Also now a days we have become very hp hungry as it's easy to get. You can get a 400+ hp car on used market for under 20kUSD and under 40kUSD on new. So people want hp

2023,"FOUND! The VIN decoder on the Toyota website showed me it does have the towing package! :D  Trying to figure out what my towing capacity is. Door sticker doesn't show a GTW.  I see online that the van had the original option of a ""towing package"". But I can't tell if they got that on the original vehicle.  Thanks."
2024,1\. SLI is jank. New APIs let people program for multiple GPUs explicitly  which is more optimal.  2\. MCM GPUs are coming  which provide the scaling benefits but present as a sane  unified GPU.  3\. Resolution and frame rate are close to being a solved issue at the high end  because of AI. DLSS 2.0 is nowhere near the peak of this technology.
2025,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\_accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting)  It may just be the case that the games industry is younger and less ""sophisticated"" in its accounting."
2026,Based on your example I’m not sure you’re going to find anything that explicitly supports conservative politics (aside from things like *Racial Holy War*  which I’m presuming is not really what you’re after). Because the only way to really do that would be to include a statement like  “We here at Capitalist Adventurers think that gay people are icky  so they don’t exist in our world.” Which is not really something that anyone’s going to say  even if it actually represents their views. Mostly what you’d be looking for is games that don’t espouse a view one way or the other.
2027,Mesa RADV/ACO will gain ray tracing support too  but this is months away. Mesa devs don't have yet access to hardware documentation   so only relay on llvm reverse engineering. But once rdna 2 is supported  they will look into ray tracing support. Khronos Vulkan extension is still not finalized  so that is another thing that needs to be worked out.  There are interesting talk from xdc2020 from Mesa ACO developer (Timur Kristof from Valve) and Mesa Intel driver developer (Jason Ekstrand from Intel) about it.  From my looks the new Vulkan cross platform RT extension is more flexible   but also way more complex than the existing nvidia extension  so it will take some time to implement and develop games that can use it. It is unknown if DXR could be translated to it (i.e. in dxvk )  but probably yes.
2028,The Great Pendragon Campaign.  The tricky part is finding a group of people willing/able to commit to the couple of years (real time) that it would take to play out the entire campaign.  You would bee looking at 100+ sessions easy.
2029,I’m currently a master’s student in a DS program  but I don’t have any relevant experience/projects. Is it worth my time to do my own projects on the side? Or will my education be enough?

2030,"This is a little off topic  but can someone explain to me what ""benefits"" if any DP 2.0(in the future) would bring versus HDMI 2.1 at 4k/120hz?  My impression is that HDMI 2.1 maxes out at around 4k/120hz at 4:4:4 HDR.  And DP 2.0 can do 4k/144hz at 4:4:4 HDR.  Is that right?  Also  is 4:4:4 the ""best""?  Like are 1080p and 1440p running at 4:4:4 or something better?  Does the CX and C9 require two cables to run them?  Or is it just one?"
2031,"If you enjoyed the Steins Gate anime  you may well enjoy the games. There's 2 of them  one covers the events shown in the main series (but in a lot more detail)  and the other game Steins Gate 0 covers the ""dark future"" timelines  showing how Okabe becomes the one you see in the message. It has a whole lot more depth and a lot of story to uncover and unpack.    I fully recommend both games  they're a visual novel style game and I don't think either have been dubbed as yet so it is a lot of reading  but your choices can lead to a number of different endings which show so much more to each character and each possible timeline variation. It gets pretty dark but it is also fascinating and very enjoyable. But with all the little choices and interactions you may want a guide  I mean maybe play through each game once and see what ending you get naturally but then you'll find a guide very useful to see all the possible routes and endings."
2032,Well after watching ep1 I went and binged climbing videos on Youtube for the last week  and if it weren't for the pandemic I would've gone to a climbing gym.  I'm totally hooked!  I understood a lot of the terminology this week (send  knee drop  dyno)  and I can recognize some of the stylistic differences between the climbers we've seen so far.  Thankfully Jun's tsundere phase only lasted 1 episode.  I like her uniformed look with the hair clip and glasses too!  Loved the captain's speech at the end about her dream of spreading climbing to the world!  Now that Jun has calmed down I think I'm going to really like the main team.  Some of the rival girls' designs also look really cool - especially the Black Panther and the Crimson Stormtrooper.  Really hope they don't continue with stuff like Spider Girl dragging other girls off to the bathroom though.  I hope this show doesn't end up like Yowapeda where I really like the main team and the competition but a few terrible antagonists ruin the show for me.
2033,So I’ve gone into the playback menu (sounds app after right clicking on the volume icon and clicking sounds) to see if the reason my all in one pc won’t play audio from its own speakers but it seems to think that my new second monitor is my main pc and is trying to play audio out of it when I doesn’t have speakers. The speaker for the main pc isn’t even in the sounds app and it doesn’t detect it at all. Anyone have a solution
2034,"So basically proving the ""10gb isn't enough"" meme to be untrue  and nvidia pushing resolution 4x greater than 4k to show off where that ram amount even matters.  the delta comes solely from 3080 = 8704cu while 3090 = 10 496 (with slightly lower clock)  has nothing to do with the vram amount."
2035,If you're looking for recommendations of an actual different system (i.e.  not just some alternate/homebrew rules to use in D&D5)  the obvious answer suggestion is [Godbound](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185959/Godbound-A-Game-of-Divine-Heroes-Free-Edition)  the OSR-ish RPG about PCs who are fledgling deities.  Stat up the evil god as a Made God or Parasite God  convert your existing PCs to Godbound of a level you consider appropriate to the powers they've gained  and you're good to go.
2036,My answer will probably come off as quite cynical. I did my undergrad in social sciences  and was infuriated with the lack of critical thinking or general intellectual rigour among a number of the students and professors in the faculty. While I generally considered myself an activist  there were people who often threw around wild claims as if they were fact  often with absolutely no hard numbers to back them up.  Quantifying and dissecting these problems so I could seperate legitimate activism from general ideological shitslinging led me to urban ethnography  which encouraged me to learn GIS. Between my statistics skills  taking some economics courses  and my technical knowledge of GIS I managed to cobble together enough credibility to get a data team to take me on in a junior position. The rest is history.
2037,I agree with you. After Alanis  Kristen  and certain others left  things just sunk. Then they re-did the website and after one week of that shite  I quit. The bookmark that I have had for so many years  has now been deleted.   And so the wheel turns.
2038,"I'm running a 5e game in Table Top Simulator currently and for plot reasons the players are going to encounter gravity distortions soon and I thought it would be super fun to have them fight monsters while in a gravity bending environment.  I was thinking of using a cross shape  [like you would cut out of paper to fold into a cube](https://images.template.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23080953/1-x-1-Paper-Cube-Template.jpg)  and then placing terrain (floating rocks) on those planes and allowing players to make acrobatics checks to attempt to transit from rock to rock and acrobatics checks to land on rocks.    The enemies I envision them fighting are like the [mana worms from world of warcraft](https://www.wow-petopia.com/images/skin_pix/manawurm2green.jpg)  so floating energy eels.  However  I'm thinking there are additional actions they could do during the fight to make things interesting or different conditions that would make things fun.  - Make all projectiles that are affected by gravity be pulled to a specific plane.  So  shooting at something in front of that plane would be a normal shot  shooting across that plane would be minor penalty  and shooting from that plane would be major penalty.  - Introducing the concept that casting spells is not inertia less and any ranged spell of the shooty variety causes you to be propelled backwards in low gravity triggering an acrobatics check.  - ""super strength"" throwing of boulders around the arena.  Basically I want it to be a low danger but high mayhem encounter for the PC's.  It's not about staying alive  so the mana worms are non-hostile unless you provoke them.  I'd considered having the gravity distortion caused by Mcguffin at the center of the field and the mana worms are protecting that and will paralyze you if you get close (or attempt to do so).  This will cause the players to fight the mana worms to break up their formation or reduce their number.    Let me know if you've got a fun idea!  If the session is successful I'll write it up for here and D&D Behind the screen.  Probably reuse it in my Star Wars campaign as well."
2039,When I need my car fix fetish satisfied  I go to a couple of sites that are captivating in many ways.  Some of you have heard of them and may have your criticisms...and some of you may appreciate a little influence towards your riddlesome auto compulsion.  Here goes nothing:  1. **Curbside Classics**: always liked the writing  research and focus on some of the cars that were not collectible or iconic.  An every man's site.  Good comments from the peanut gallery.  Take a look   [https://www.curbsideclassic.com/](https://www.curbsideclassic.com/)  2) **Bring a Trailer** (aka BAT): also a fun site to visit that has monetized recently becoming an online car auction (some regulars objected  but who cares...since the site is still dedicated to used collectible cars and appreciating the crowd sourced commentary).  You check it out and make your observations   [https://bringatrailer.com/](https://bringatrailer.com/)  3) **Jalopnik**: Different then the above two sites  Jalopnik takes a broader view of the automobile's impact on culture.  There's a little bit of everything here.  You'll just have to see it for yourself   [https://jalopnik.com/](https://jalopnik.com/)  4) **Hemmings Motor News**: an online extension of the old school paper monthly catologue of used car want ads.  Lot's of good writing and photos on collectible cars.  [https://www.hemmings.com/](https://www.hemmings.com/)  5) **The Selvedge Yard**: you don't want to miss this site  which is probably more obscure then the four sites above.  Here  you'll find more photography and a heavy motorcycle   bimbos  art photography influence.  Definitely worth a look.  See this and get your grove back on:  \--a) [https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/08/11/old-school-hurst-girls/](https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/08/11/old-school-hurst-girls/)  \--b) [**https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/12/09/bettie-page-and-bunny-yeager-legendary-queens-of-pin-up/**](https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/12/09/bettie-page-and-bunny-yeager-legendary-queens-of-pin-up/)  \--c)  [https://selvedgeyard.com/2009/08/06/ralph-sonny-barger-an-outlaws-tale-of-harleys-highways-hell/](https://selvedgeyard.com/2009/08/06/ralph-sonny-barger-an-outlaws-tale-of-harleys-highways-hell/)  \--d) [https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/10/17/relive-drag-racings-top-rivalry-1110-the-snake-vs-the-mongoose/](https://selvedgeyard.com/2010/10/17/relive-drag-racings-top-rivalry-1110-the-snake-vs-the-mongoose/)  &#x200B   6) **Barnfinds**: sort of true to what Bring a Trailer was before becoming an auction site...and...now  recently noticed that Barnfinds is following BAT into monetization (it's now an auction site).  But...you'll have to look for yourselves. [https://barnfinds.com/](https://barnfinds.com/)
2040,There are zero graphics cards that run DP 2.0. Zero.  The latest and greatest Nvidia 30xx series cards only support DP 1.4a (and HDMI 2.1).  Currently monitor manufactures can choose to either double the inputs (and have each half section of monitor mosaic and act as one whole unit)  which has been seen in the past as a terrible experience at best  or a horrible experience due to differences in overdrive settings on each half  causing it to be practically unusable  or they can use DSC.  If you aren't happy with either then you'll need to wait until the next series of cards either next year or two years from now release with DP 2.0 support (assuming AMD doesn't include it in their RDNA2 lineup  which I have my doubts since the standard was finished not that long ago and design verification and implementation takes time).  There are practically zero GPU's that can run non-esports games at 4k 120hz  let alone 4k144hz. Doom Eternal on the new 30xx cards is one of the few non-esports titles  but that game is insanely well optimized using an in-house engine (not general engines such as Unity or Unreal). Average 4k FPS's tend to be around 70-90 for high end ( Borderlands 3 for example on a 3080 runs at just 60FPS.)  maybe 110 for highest-end cards in other smaller titled non-open world games. It isn't economically viable aside from a few niche cases to market such monitors  and as a result  there isn't that much of a push towards fixing it faster since it wouldn't really be utilized  and HDMI 2.1 already solves the 4k 120hz problem. By the time graphics cards capable of running at such high resolutions are released they will have implemented DP 2.0  but as of now HDMI 2.1 solves that issue for the vast majority of cases.
2041,Looks cool  I will check it out as I haven’t played part 3 of the series before  but I have two questions:  What do they mean with cross platform multiplayer? This is pc-only afaik  When will we stop getting remasters and start getting new games? Where is AoE4?
2042,I've always been partial to WEG's Star Wars (system now available as d6 Space). Easy to design and customize ships. Scales well from land vehicles on the to capital ships. Different types and powers of weapons. Does mean a lot of d6s  but that's never bothered me.  Have to say  though. I've only flown one battle in the news Genesys Star Wars  and it was a lot of fun.  Ultimately  though  most space game systems *can* give you good  enjoyable starship combat. It comes down to group style and preference.
2043,Cautiously excited about this one  i enjoy the concept and the devs seem like they're pretty agile and fast with development.    However  i don't see myself investing in it until combat gets to a better state  right now there really is 0 impact to it.    Curious to see where questing goes in the future too.
2044,If NVIDIA can flood the market with enough cards at launch  they will pretty much corner the market before AMD hits the shelves. If AMD truly does have a card faster than a 2080ti  they should have launched it months ago.
2045,What a sad state of affairs that these comments are just people trying argue that a 6 day working week is totally normal and acceptable. We might as well have never had unions for all that certain people care about the concessions they won.
2046,This is already done with small computers that use external power bricks. An example would be consoles  but there are a selection of PCs that do this too  laptop motherboards of course do this too. It does improve airflow and the heat form the psu / power brick does not impact the closed system.
2047,"I'm going to recommend two (three?) games with very grim settings  but I find them to be excellent  rules light  story driven games.  The first game is [Ten Candles](https://cavalrygames.com/ten-candles).  This isn't fantasy (but it can be). This game assumes an in person setting using only the eponymous ten candles for illumination. The system is extremely open ended but it involves a pool of 10d6s that are shared by the group. Every time a roll is failed  a candle goes out  a die gets removed from that pool  and you move onto the next scene. By the end of the session  everyone is dead (**important disclaimer**: the characters  not the players). Needless to say  this is a game for one-shots. The default setting is modern day earth after a bizarre event in which the sun went out  and after a while ""they"" appeared. They live in the dark and they're coming for you. But you could easily modify the default setting to something like the North of Westeros during the Long Night (in fact the end of the book is an assortment of different starting premises).  The constrained nature of the setting and the great yet simple rules make for a **very** immersive role-playing experience. I ran this game once and I really felt like this system gave me super powers  as a GM  although you probably can't spring the game on the same audience very often. However  I recommend it so you can get a very immersive experience. Not  mind you  because other games *can't* generate this level of immersion (I've had it before and since)  just because of all the games I know  this one seems to be the more likely to guarantee you will have it.  The second and third games are the two versions of [Trophy](https://trophyrpg.com/). This is a horror fantasy RPG that has a very simple rule set (originally released as Cthulhu Dark)  with the premise of doomed treasure hunters going into a forest in search of treasure and becoming corrupted by it. Much like Ten Candles  it was originally a one shot RPG with a tragic end built into it. However  it has since split into **Trophy Dark**  the original version  and **Trophy Gold ** a slightly less tragic version which assumes your character can not only survive  but also eventually earn enough treasure to retire and have a presumably happy ending. *Gold* is slightly more complex than *Dark*  but still orders of magnitude more simple than D&D. Its goal is to find a middle ground between the tragic horror of Trophy Dark and the exploration driven fantasy of ""Old School Renaissance"" games."
2048,You are absolutely right about available interfaces. And there are plenty of answers about jobs and Python  so I won't say anything along those lines. But I urge you to have some faith in your R skills and the ecosystem provided by the #rstats community.  See https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8de54s/is_r_better_than_python_at_anything_i_started/ ( courtesy @shaggorama) - this might be a bit dated and many of the shortcomings mentioned might have been rectified  but it still gives you some perspective  and probably confidence  about the R ecosystem.
2049,Here's my two cents: perhaps you can pre-empt the interviewers by showing your interest in business  like  an one liner to suggest you do your reading on business (see below).  My first job after my PhD was a local IT management consulting firm  and common business-y terms like value proposition  business value  strategy/tactics  and position statement were quite foreign to me. Reading quite a bit of Harvard Business Review and MIT Sloan Management Review  thought leadership more specific to data like those from McKinsey Global Institute  and some classic works by Peter Drucker helped me a ton. Within a year I found myself almost speaking differently  or so remarked my former labmates.
2050,I think data engineering will outlast data science. Machine learning will become increasingly productionised and automated  but data gathering and storage will become increasingly complex. Being able to consolidate large volumes of data suitable for downstream processing will be a challenge for years. Most companies I encountered who were interested in exploring machine learning didn't have any data  or didn't collect anything useful for modelling.
2051,"The 997.2 is from 2009-2012 for those not deep enough into Porsche to care about the internal designations or willing to hit up Wikipedia. The "".2"" is because of a mid-cycle refresh in 2009 while the 997 first appeared in MY 2005.  Even though I'm a fan of the 911 I've always found the use of the internal designation by enthusiasts and journalists a tad confusing especially when they are talking to the general public. I do realize that this is done with plenty of other cars but with the 911 (and some others)  it's a bit more confusing as that number skips around a bit."

2053,I keep flurting with the idea of getting a Tesla  but shit like this is what keeps me on the fence. I like the cars and could even stand some of the build quality issues  but how the company is run scares the shit out of me. I'd need some answer to questions like  do you plan to allow 3ed party repairs  what is the deal with that time you down graded someone car after they sold it  and I know the things are fast but i would like a car guys opinion on the handling.      I'm looking at the Mach E more and more  just want to see a review on how it drives.
2054,These standards are based on what needs them. Many people perhaps you are too young to remember when PCI and RAM standards were changing very fast. But then PCIe just got good  like real good. And for the base consumer we had quite a good run of years where it was plenty good enough to take care of the majority of our needs and that was in large part because nothing we had could push the bus hard hard drives were slow  we already had many times the internet needs and USB needs and everything else we needed locally. But then something happened. SSDs happened  they got fast and highly parallel. And they quickly saturated any interface they were given within a short time. So SATA had to keep bumping up  but that was never good enough so then they went into the PCI bus  and even that can be saturated. SSDs are just fucking off the hook and pushing things hard.
2055,The success of [Choice of Robots](https://store.steampowered.com/app/339350/Choice_of_Robots/) was very surprising to me. It seemed like the kind of a game would be impossible to market for. Is there a place on the market for these kinds of games? What about a full RPG made in text form  would that work? Would you be open to the possibility to play a text-based RPG?
2056,I’m looking into a 2011 VW Jetta TDI  anybody have some good things to lookout for  and some stuff to know? It has 100 000 on the odo and the dealer is asking 7k (sf California)  I’m looking for this to be a reliable daily driver that I can keep forever. I’m a car enthusiast and do most maintenance myself  and have worked on VW in the past.
2057,DX12 and vulkan both technically allow for something called explicit multi GPU where the systems GPUs are all seen as one big lump and are just given stuff to do it has the benefit of being hardware agnostic early testing on the few games to ever support it (so ashes of the singularity) showed that it scaled best when you had an AMD GPU as the main one and then literally anything as secondary be it NVidia or an intel iGPU  problem is all the implementation is on the developers and its a royal ball ache to implement it correctly so somewhere near fuck and all games have implemented it recently  (i'm really dumbing that first bit down because i can't remember half of it myself but i think its mostly correct)
2058,"The problem with stratified splits is that they are not representative of the real world. Meaning that your performance on the test set will have nothing to do with actual real world performance. This is not a good thing.  I personally would get a random test set  but use stratified splitting for training & validation sets. That way I can effectively train models and validate them and do comparisons/model selection  but the test set is representative of the real world (assuming your data collection is representative of the real world... a whole another can of worms).  Training-serving skew is a big ""gotcha"" that everyone always forgets about. It's not something they really teach in data science programs/courses  because the people teaching it are academic statisticians and don't realize that in the real world  the models actually go into production and the work doesn't stop at reporting the accuracy % in a paper.  I do k-fold with random sampling and within that loop I do my training&validation splits. Sometimes random  sometimes stratified  sometimes I have some other technique for creating the datasets."
2059,Umu! Man  Nero really changed her look!  I dunno  I'd just wish for the end of the world event to be cancelled.  I guess MC really did no nothing about baseball if he thought he'd get more than 3 strikes.  Anyway  seems interesting so far  so lets see where it goes.
2060,Ok so clearly I think I am missing something here.  I have a 2015 Infiniti QX50.  My fog lights double as my DRLs.  For my low beams  the car has Xenon headlights. HOWEVER  there is also a small halogen bulb in the assembly that lights up on the side of the Xenon lights (and is on with the Xenon lights). According to my owner's manual  this is an H11 bulb. This is not for the high beams  which is a different bulb  Is it normal to have 2 sets of low beams? I tried googling this  but did not seem to get anywhere. Clearly I am not understanding something here...  **Part 2 of my question**: I needed to replace one of my fog lights and have ordered a Diode Dynamics LED fog light. Is it possible to replace the halogen lowbeam with an LED to match the color of the Xenon headlight? Not looking to blind on-coming traffic  just looking for something that looks nice :)  Thanks everyone.

2062,> French (from France) > Quebecois > anglophone > everyone else  Shouldn't that be francophone? I'm assuming if you're neither from France nor Quebec but you do speak French  you'd still be in a better position than someone who speaks only English.  Otherwise I can only guess that the above hierarchy is meant to imply that there are people at the company who speak neither French nor English  and those people are treated the worst out of anybody.
2063,[I've seen something similar.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/382050/Eon_Altar/)  At least  in the sense that you're using a shared screen and a phone for secret information.    Diablo-lite style action RPG where you and at least four (maybe more  there were four of us) play the game on a TV using a smartphone as a controller/character sheet  when the dialog/looting sections start up  each player has different text on their phones indicating how the conversation goes  sometimes revealing information the player might want to keep secret.    Eon Altar was built in [Unity 4.7](https://steamcommunity.com/app/382050/discussions/0/520518053450153106/) according to their FAQ.  [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/81k6lk/question_connecting_a_mobile_app_to_a_pc_game/) suggests something called UNIPLAY may be needed  though the asset linked to in the OP is no longer available and  being a two year old post  I do not know how accurate the information is.
2064,"Porsche technician here. I exclusively fix Porsches for a living.   Cost of maintenance and repairs. If you're a DIY-er  most of them are somewhere between annoying and very difficult to work on.   If you're buying any Porsche  parts are generally slightly more expensive for normal stuff  and anything that needs to be replaced that isn't a common issue gets to be very expensive very quickly.   All modern Porsches have shitty body drains and are prone to flooding and taking out very expensive modules that can only be fixed at the dealer. They're prone to rodent issues as well  particularly the modern sports cars since people let them sit.   The sports cars are all challenging to work on if you're used to fixing normal front engine cars. Working inside and on top of mid engine boxsters and Caymans is annoying. Your back will be feeling it. Cramming your fingers and arms into places they don't belong on 911s gets old.   A significant amount of ""normal"" jobs require things like removing the exhaust system or removing the whole engine. Air oil separator on a 996 auto  lol. That'll be 12-14 hours labor for a $100 part please.   Don't forget just serious mechanical flaws. 986s and 996s especially. It's not just IMS  there's more. If you're paying someone like me  that cheap boxster you just bought needs a $3k IMS job. It may also needs $4k worth of vario cam chain guide repairs. Don't forget the regular chain guides can fail prematurely. And definitely get your wallet out for that $1000-1500 water pump job and $600 ignition coils that you'll need every 40-80k.  Air cooleds get crazy to expensive to own. Anyone that says otherwise is lying to themselves.   Newer 997.2+ seem to be a lot better than everything that came before it. But they're expensive to buy.   Tldr: they're not cheap to own. I'm sure some 996 die hard is going to write to me about how wrong I am. I'm right. I've fixed more 996s than 99.9% of mechanics. I've worked on every model except the Carrera GTs  918s  and the really obscure old stuff.  I love Porsches but I hate working on them. I plan to stop working on them professionally. I plan to own one and DIY it."
2065,I’m so over Xbox... the only reason to have a console was to not have to worry about whether the other people were getting better performance in games. How do they not realize they’re killing their brand hard right now
2066,Hola! Yo recién estoy metiendome en esto de la programación de videojuegos y por ahora es solo un hobbie. De todas formas dando vueltas por LinkedIn nunca he visto que busquen desarrolladores de juegos  a excepción de Etermax (la empresa detras de Preguntados). Tampoco he visto muchos juegos hechos en Argentina  pero seguramente debe haber.
2067,I'm fairly decent at picking up new systems and getting a good understanding of them to run a session or two.  Related is my ability to find additional resources for learning a new system  so that I can share them with my players (who will never read/watch/listen to  but it's proven useful for *other* groups).  I'm also rather tolerate for beer-n-pretzels groups.  I don't care much for immersion  but I enjoy the clicky-clack of dice rolling and getting into silly adventures.
2068,They try to put it as a good thing while it's half the framerate they should aim for considering what sony claimed lel. They are also claiming that 60 FPS at 120Hz is not identical to 60 FPS at 60 Hz but that it has some magical advantage.
2069,>  How demanding people from TT/RPGs in modern times?   There are a lot of them out there  so your game will need something to sell it. English is the biggest market  but it's also the most competitive: publishing in your own language might give more of a gap in the market.   > The ways to publish?   Make a PDF  stick it on some combination of itch.io  DriveThruRPG  and personal websites/forums/etc.  tell people about it.   > - How people interested in complex  hard to GM yet possibly easy for player systems (like when most math done behind-the-scenes and can be narratively described)?   Could we just... not have the complexity? Especially if it's all on the GM side  there's very likely a much simpler solution that's functionally indistinguishable from the player side.   > - How people interested in high fantasy 19th century?   Sure  why not. There's no reason you couldn't build an interesting setting that fits into that category. There's not enough information to say anything more  though.   > I'd like make it free  yet monetization without selling it directly would be nice.  Pay What You Want (for single products) or Patreon (if you're putting out things regularly) are the usual options for that.
2070,They've got some real eccentric characters at this rock climbing tournaments. A girl just casually walking around with a bunny ears headband and a chick constantly talking in cat puns.   Not to mention that girl they were watching a video of at the beginning that seemed to be acting more like an idol than an athlete.
2071,There are still a fiew things to consider:  * How important is the battery live? Are 2-3 hours enough for you?  * Do you need a touchscreen? Does it even have to be a convertible (so you can use it as a tablet) * Any brand which is a NoGo? For example I like the huawei laptops  but many people simply won't buy anything from a chinese brand  The more you can say the better we can choose a fitting laptop for you :)
2072,I can relate to your problem because I have always had the same feelings and I have been GMing from the winter of 74 till this day. I do minimal prep for running games that consists of a list of monsters and their stats that can be found in the area the party will be in. A variation of the 5 room dungeon idea where everything is a simple multiple of 5  so a 5 10 15 20  to whatever many rooms that you need  ideas for this can be done weeks or years in advance. I tend to not do a lot of prep the day before as that amplifies the nerves and even if I don’t prep I use an overview type layout of my vague plan for the game  that consists of no more than two lines of what may be in a certain hex  or dungeon square. I find a massive amount of prepping only makes me more nervous and then my group usually goes in a different direction anyway. I hope that this helps and know that you are not alone.
2073,Hello! Thank you for the tutorial  however I would like to ask some questions for anyone who understand this stuffs.  1. What exactly happen in 3D plane with Fractal Displacement step?  2. How do you make Rectangular to Polar Coordinate? and Could it be any shape you want?  3. What is Alpha Boost step  how is it different than just alpha?  4. How do you make Lightness-based Vector Displacement?  5. what is Trap code? is it something similar to fluid simulator in Embergen/Houdini? What do you get out of of it  textures/animation sheets? I checked the website but look like it's for Adobe After Effect. and it's very pricey!  Thank you guys
2074,Another vote for R.  It's open source so it's continuously evolving while Matlab is more static.  Proficiency in both R and Python will help you get a job after graduation while Matlab is less portable.
2075,I just watched darling in the franxx and I’m looking for anime’s like it where the girl is different from everyone or has some bad rumor surrounding her and gets judged for it but the MC doesn’t care and likes her anyways. Thanks!!

2077,Unpopular opinion: This crunch kinda makes sense to me. They have already delayed multiple times  and now the release line up pretty close to the new console releases. Many people are planning on having this and AC be their first games on the new consoles. Delaying and further would likely have massive ramifications.
2078,I had a good amount of programming experience before trying R for the first time and I found it to be the most confusing language I ever tried. I found that I had to let go of all my preexisting notions of how a programming language should work to learn R.

2080,Thank you for sharing  and hope you're at a better job now.  I've stopped buying their games (and playing them) because of the awful stories coming out from there.  I'm not giving them any more money.  And you don't have to be sorry  you're a person and deserve to be treated like one.
2081,So  I’ve owned every PlayStation. But...i am not excited about this one. What’s the real draw? The PS4 is still badass. It feels too early. Nobody has 8K right now. I just don’t get it. I don’t feel the need to upgrade.
2082,"I'm not sure which rpg you are talking about  but if it's one of the FFG d% ones  there's a few things to consider.  You sustain damage seldomly but if something connects  it hits like a truck. Wound levels extending into the negative and uncertainty how much you have exactly left (you die on < -7  depending on hit location and damage type)  makes you feel very vulnurable.  The single die roll also really pushes home the uncaring and cruel world having you at the mercy of the dice for basically any action.  Concerning lore  I'd say go ahead and change as much as you want  but equipment and talents really reflect some aspects of the setting  so you might want to start from the original idea just so it all ties together in the end.  I think you certainly can change it away from grimdark to a more gritty and ""regular dark"" science fiction  but I don't think you will get into heroic stories with these mechanics. Also take care to make the ridiculous elements of the lore a bit more modest. The wide mood swings somewhat balance each other and both contribute to the unique feel of the setting  but I think if you tone down only one aspect  the other easily becomes overpowering."
2083,"Watched the first 5 mins muted with closed captioning (at work) and had to stop due to the abundance of ""likes"" and ""you knows.""  Felt like I was reading a teenager's English paper.  From the content I did gather  it seemed like a pretty rough go with staff turnover and supervisors switching up things every time they turned around  though.  That's bad for business."
2084,TLDR since the title is odd:   Higher energy bills due to hardware and technological requirements in general.  Low usage at off peak times  Limited hardware able to utilize due to costs  The above are not chinese specific but more of a finding from a location that is installing a bunch of equipment. Pretty interesting and will probably be a thing in other areas with the auto shutdown at off peak times. Given the ability to meet a vast majority of speed needs it might be more fiscally advisable to makne ones 4g lte systems more robust and hope that newer specs are developed and be ready for manufacturing that fix some of the above issues. Things like AV1 codec could make your network last a bit longer also as netflix and youtube are 20 of traffic alone.  What problem is 5g even solving? 2g  edge  and 3g worked for text and basic images but fail as soon as you add video or any filesharing whatsoever. 4g fixes the majority of those problems.
2085,Are you shifting all the way to 1st gear via the paddles ? I find in my dct when using paddles I only down shift manually into 2nd. The car will automatically move to 1st once at a complete stop.   Shifting all the way to first before coming to a complete stop causes some stress on the transmission I can hear.
2086,> about two and a half weeks now  OK  sounds like you're probably at the very beginning of dev  unless you're making something pretty small. Sounds like you might be doing some [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). Sometimes development is just like that.
2087,"Legend of the Galactic Heroes  'nuff said. It's a 100 episode space opera  and it's unlike any sci-fi anime you've probably seen before. It's a smart show that respects the viewer's intelligence  without being ""big brained"".  It's one of the best anime I've ever seen  and I say that as someone who doesn't even like space operas."
2088,Not sure if it's any help  but you could try using something like [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) or [Plod](https://plod.app/#/).  The former is an option for explaining your models  the latter for your analysis.
2089,I replaced the waterpump  thermostat  and radiator anything else? it runs hot after about 10minutes i heard a lot of bad stuff about the 2.7 after i already purchased it so i have to deal with it. Has this ever happen to anyone else with the same engine? If so what was your problem?
2090, Hades has now sold more than 1 000 000 copies.  700 000 of these were during our Early Access development. To all our Early Access players: Thank you so much. We designed Hades for Early Access  believing you could help us make a better game. That's just what you did. \#HadesGame   ***  posted by [@SupergiantGames](https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames)  [Video in Tweet](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1307744227833470976/pu/pl/rIDZ_2GwmYwOF291.m3u8?tag=10)   ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username)
2091,"Started off strong but got a little too opinionated in the negatives. Yes it looks like a 'grandma'  but how do brakes look 'dumb'? My grandma certainly doesn't look like a Prius. If she looked like any car it would probably be Beetle  all squashed up and hunched over.  Then a comment about how you would rather look cool speeding and be looked at favorably by the police. Not sure if that's a sell point or what I'm supposed to feel here.  You also mention little experience in other cars  but somehow  ' The ABS system is one of the best of vehicles I’ve driven ' is supposed to have relevance.  The part I found most impressive was that the steering wheel allows you to control temperature. That's pretty damn cool.  I also feel the relationship with the car changed through out starting at ""**my** Prius"" and ending with ""slalom in **that thing**""  I give it a 7/10."
2092,Maybe true? In my experience  a good coder can use their ability to built things to amplify whatever math skills they might have. I see it all the time with ML side projects. Good javascript programmers can build some really cool things with pretrained models and npm packages. It can take a while for the mathy person to build something useful.
2093,invulnerability is always nice but it may cause you to not take it serious or abuse the game mostly.  one idea would be scripted events that would require you to pay attention to and do certain things and the npc kind of dashing from one cover to another. basically when you mess up you got a certain number of fails you can have indicated by ie animation (holding wound). that way your escort doesnt die because its stupid but it completely depends on you and your actions/reactions if your escort dies or not
2094,The development machine I used for my last game was a 2009 iMac. If you are creating software on an older device then performance testing can be less of an issue. If a game is optimised for an older device then a newer machine should generally due to improvements in hardware. 2017 is still a really  really new machine.
2095,>…there a proper way to make a tile based game?  I think you gotta forget the word “proper” for a moment  because it just ends up tripping you up and making you think about the wrong things. Same with the word “best”. What’s the proper way to make a tile-based game? What’s the best engine to make a tile-based game? Not really a great way to frame the discussion  it usually spirals into a bunch of people stating opinions and feelings.  >…I am not sure if that is the right route to go.  The only thing that matters is if the route is right specifically for *you.* You can totally make a city builder game in JavaScript  and the great thing about JavaScript is that it’s very easy to share your game with other people so they can play it. Just send ’em a link and they can play in the browser.  The browser is a solid game platform these days  with Canvas2D and WebGL options  gamepad support  full-screen  fancy audio support  etc. You got a number of different engines to choose from.  So just choose an option that looks reasonable. Pick an engine and environment that suits your taste and your skill level.
2096,The problem with 90s Japanese cars in the are getting rarer/more expensive. When miatas and 240s are fetching north of $5-6k for stock (if you can even find one) it gets harder for younger kids to save up the cash to buy it so they have to get a car that they can get a loan on or buy outright.  I’m 21 and saw this coming 2-3 years ago when I bought my S14. So as far as kids mine age liking the car yeah but they are just getting harder to find. Just like there are really no muscle cars like 60s muscle cars there really aren’t cars like 90s Japanese car and they will always have a place with enthusiasts.
2097,I recently launched an RPG system that I have been working on for a few years. It's designed to boil down tabletop role-playing to its most basic elements to give new players the essential experience of playing tabletop RPGs without necessitating that they buy expensive books or lots of equipment. I hope you find it interesting and enjoyable!
2098,You have to understand jeep doesn't care about your warranty it's gone. Now with that there are grace periods and maybe due to current world situations they have extended it but you need to see if there is one. Honestly more than likely you will have to pay for some out of pocket sorry.
2099,I think this will be my next GPU  should be a very nice upgrade from my GTX 970. Also the same class die: From cut down GM104 to cut down GA104.  But let's wait for pricing  benchmarks and what AMD has to offer.
2100,So because I haven’t kept up...Is there zero backwards compatibility for PS1-2-3 games  or will some games work like the few PS2 games did for PS4?
2101,I have a 2019 WRX PP that I daily drive averaging around 24k miles annually. Stock wheel/tire sizes are 18” with 245/40/18 tires.  I’m debating on downsizing to a 17x8 lightweight Enkei (15.5 lbs each) wheel with a 245/45/17 tire that is also lighter by 1lb each over the OE tire. I’m WAG’ing that the OE 18” wheels are close to 25lbs each if not more.  The unsprung weight reduction should help the engine feel a little more lively during lower speed acceleration & cornering  and the 17” tire has a Y speed with an XL rating too to help mitigate sidewall compression during harder cornering.  Would there be any driving related reasons why I shouldn’t do this?  PS: I’m a fan of smaller lighter weight wheels over the “larger is better” trend that has taken hold over the last decade.
2102,Feels a bit all over the place  because you're mixing asset management with rendering optimizations.  Anyway: Virtual filesystems  resource packages/compression  optimized asset formats (e.g. SPIRV for shaders).
2103,I do all data roles. I'm embedded in a different department but belong to the same analytics team. Kinda have to manage it myself  but the data engineers tend to have deeper work on production related stuff.
2104,Greatly enjoy **Ironsworn** and now I'm trying to branch out into playing solo those games which were designed for traditional group play.  There are various systems to help you do this  and while reading about them I have come to a deeper understanding of how their various mechanisms are rolled into the regular mechanics of Ironsworn  so that the game is inherently playable on your own. I think this will probably allow me to play more fulfilling Ironsworn games too  as I can be sure to lean into the parts of the game which are designed to take the weight in solo play.
2105,I played this game too fast. I have a tendency to just rip through games  if I like them. I got platinum on this game within a week and had completed everything possible. Sadly  I have nothing really left to do with it  so I’m looking forward to getting more life out of this amazing game.
2106,Receiving daily listings from autotrader is one of my little pleasures in life.  A couple of years ago I set up one for FJ Cruisers because I thought maybe I'd pick up a used one.  As most know on this board  FJ prices have become completely insane.  Well  I definitely need to set an upper price so that I don't get listings like this anymore:  https://i.imgur.com/rgVUnbw.jpg  It's kinda depressing and very frustrating.  I'll just buy something new at that price thank you very much.
2107,Greetings! I recently teamed up with fellow RPG supernerd [u/pixie1001](https://www.reddit.com/u/pixie1001/) to create an itty-bitty comedy game about backstabbing  beguiling and magicking your way to the top of the Fairy Kingdom!  # [Here's the game!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hy2JQavbh-CaIMcotUlK3X8UJxUXqimX/view?usp=sharing)  [**Link to all the extra doohickies**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZFDzvv8TwhxTcqWr0PuMLpMJb0HXwv2-?fbclid=IwAR1X7A3JkcmkxdOJmUXTtau4Iqrlz_Ap9Xny0MS_7Q9XJ6gqKE5nbp-EBGU)  &#x200B   * Check it out  take a look at the pretty rulebook  and give me your best (or worst) drive-by critique! * Oh  and since this is still the playtest version  there's an anonymous feedback form in the linked folder for all your extra mean critiques.  ) * If you do end up finding time to give it a go  consider dropping some feedback  or even inviting me along to see how it goes?
2108,Dialogue. I have a hard time characterising two NPCs interacting.  Less-than-serious tones. With the exception of Paranoia  I don't respond well to slapstick humour in games  and if the group is leaning towards comedy  I feel less invested. :(
2109,I have a hard time talking in character  in actually acting out the NPCs. Usually I take a more top down approach and just tell the party the information conveyed with some notes on how they interpret body language  tone  etc. my justification is it’s faster and a more accurate way to convey my intent but I’m sure it’s less fun than it could have been.   Oddly  as a player I usually find it easy to talk in character
2110,What got your started? Did you first 'invest' in the one super interesting project  one with a guaranteed payoff  etc?   How often do you back new projects? How do you select those worth doing so?  Do you privilege a certain type of product? For example  is it easier to sell you on cool dice than on setting books?   For you  is backing stuff more about the final result  or giving creators a chance and/or a helping hand?  Of the completed projects you've backed  which were your favourites? Any pleasant surprises? Big disappointments?  Anything interesting you'd recommend looking into atm?
2111,High power figures are easy enough to pull out of them they take boost like a absolutely legend and as a plus side they have bigger oil ports then the RB and have less issues with cooling as a result plus the noises they make are very nice
2112,If I had to guess  it's basically the jdm version of the ls swap. The jz platform likely has a lot of aftermarket support and strong oem internals so big power can be made before upgraded pistons and crankshaft are required.

2114,Just relax. The field is diverse operate on a need to know basis. If for whatever reason a particular project / task requires advanced math  which I think is unlikely for an applied role instead of a research one then you can always review at the time.   You'd be surprised how many people even in research positions may struggle. Personally I have a background in high energy physics  my maths skills are far beyond most ML practicioners and even when I am reading ML papers I can't be bothered to go through the maths  99% of the time it's not interesting and it does not add value to the conceptual understanding. I will dig into the maths only if I need to actually build something based on that.
2115,For my sanity could you clear up one thing  ask yourself truly  do you just want to learn to make pixel art or do you want to learn how to make games or do you NEED to learn both? Because I’ll be honest you are 16-17 y/o and I doubt you already have 1 of these skills already. Deciding to do both means learning 2 real big things. Not saying it’s impossible but I think knowing what you want deep down will produce greater results. But as digital artist of 15 years with a degree I still struggle with pixel art as a style. As 4 years self taught in unreal  unity and c++ I’m still not making great 2d or pixel art games as well as I do FPS or 3rd person rpgs. I think the dev is more important to focus on rather than the art. Make place holder art first that has the correct technical requirements and just update the art later when you improve your skills. I believe many of us would support that process.
2116,Fortunately for you  that year came with a timing chain. Also  those Corolla’s are pretty bullet proof (obviously depending on previous owner maintenance).  However  at that mileage you should probably give the water pump and serpentine belts a replacement. Also a tune-up and new fluids (spark plugs/wires  oil  filters  etc) is a good idea.   Congrats on your first car.
2117,This is anecdotal  so take it for what it's worth.  My manager always wants equivalent experience over an advanced degree.  This is at a large company with a huge DS team focused on predictions and deep learning. If you want to go into an academic or research focused role  this won't necessarily be the case.  You'll likely need to heavily rely on the skills you pick up in academia for success in those roles.  However  you don't pick up a good chunk of skills you need for a lot of DS jobs in academia.  quick edit: I'll add that having a masters definitely won't hurt you ever.  If you can't find a job in this job market  waiting it out for a couple years and getting a degree isn't a bad idea if you can afford it.
2118,I think it's tough to enter the industry without at least a master's degree  but I've seen people do it. Most companies are looking for people with MSc or PhD backgrounds. I'd say this academic background would actually help you on the job because it is difficult to really understand relevant statistical theory just by running some code on Kaggle.  Having said this  you could still get a DS role and do well at it  but it will take some perseverance. Notice that some DS jobs are heavily analytical and given your background with Alteryx and Tableau  I would recommend focusing on those.

2120,Who cares. Sony must be shaking in their boots now after the huge buy up Microsoft have just done. Sony simply don't have enough money to compete with Microsoft with this next gen battle. Microsoft could buy Sony out right and still have billions left.
2121,This isn't new  ARM based MS Surface devices have been doing this for awhile.  The results are pretty mixed  there is definitely a performance hit and some applications just won't work or will exhibit weird behavior.  The take away from the Surface world is its a nice feature but if you actually need this to run applications for your day to day work or core tasks get an x86 based system. As more mainstream apps slowly move to natively run on ARM that will likely change over time.
2122,My buddy from work has been electric for a couple years. ( Smart for two electric upgraded to kia soul ev) Took him  almost 4 hours to go from Montreal to st-agath des monts. (1.5hrs drive). Once he told me this crazy story  he drove from Montreal to Quebec  took him like 5 hours  to turn around and drive another 7 hours to come back! To drop off prescious cargo. With all the recharging :/
2123, Hey guys! Posting here as I place myself closer to data science than computer science/coding in general — but please point me to a more suitable subreddit for this type of question if you can.  TLDR: after watching some anime I thought that learning data science/programming has a lot in common with what protagonists undergo throughout the series. List of questions below.  &#x200B   1. In some stories  a hero has to master certain techniques (=coding/analysis methods)  understanding of his enemies/different battling conditions (=domains&different problems you can tackle)  as well as train your spirit (=soft skills  e.g. grit to push through a problem  meta-skills like knowing how to approach a new problem/domain  etc). I wonder if you can make an effective learning path by approaching a DS education in the same way that a good anime takes you through a protagonist's development.     2. Zooming in  one of the crucial skills you need to power through learning data science and get good at it is not quitting when you face a problem  e.g. you can't troubleshoot your code or you're stuck and can't find a solution. As I see it  the basic idea is: when you work in data science  there's always something you don't know. There are hundreds of layers between what you type in your IDE and the result that comes out: you work with libraries  then there's python code that you write  open-source tools  several layers of data architecture  infrastructure  your OS  algorithms  networking/data eng quirks and so on. Even seasoned data scientists know like 30% of the stack they utilize to get results. So it's okay to not know something  you just need to stay motivated to learn more  aiming for a point when you know like 80% of quirks that can happen when working on your chosen role & domain. Explaining the importance of this aspect to a newbie is somewhat hard and it seems like a short comics might do better than a lecture here. Have you seen any related comics that get ideas like that across?     3. This approach would work well for someone who is really passionate about mastering data science in detail like those anime characters master their craft (whatever that may be). I guess you can call it a samurai way or whatever when someone focused all their energy on a single thing and get incredibly good at it. Do you think this would work for the rest 90% of people who aren't ready to go all-in in that manner? I put myself in that 90%  and yet I feel really inspired by this type of character  so maybe it would work for the rest of us as well?     4. I'm interested in this idea because it shows how much more there is to know about data science than most courses teach you. Most of those walks you through hard skills  usually without even connecting them to actual domains & typical applications. Some bootcamps give you a chance to train your soft skills when completing small end-to-end projects in a team  but it still feels very limited. I'll be glad if someone proves me w
2124,"Well for starters  if keeping track of distances and things is an issue  use a grid and makers. Let go of the hangup on expensive or hard crafted stuff for now. Get a grid that you can draw on. Use coins or whatever you can find to represent characters and monsters. That’s it. Forget ""I’d love to have beautiful..."".   Assign some players to help keep track of things: let Lars keep track of HP loss for most mundane monsters. Give Gunnar the intiative tracker. Etc... you can call them co-dm’s"
2125,> Now I can make Dash dashboards/tools & deploy them. Configure security  auth  etc.  How do you deploy them - through a web framework like Flask/Django? Wondering how exactly you achieve the security aspect of this.
2126,For anyone possibly interested  I highly recommend this let's play series done by the lead designer and one of the devs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_wKAvyPJ5M  It's very entertaining and gives a great feel for what the rules  goals  and gameplay is like. Covers all of the basics: scheming  combat  child assassination  holy wars  incest.  I knew a little bit about CK2 and tried playing it a couple of times but found it waaay too involved.  I watched this series and was hooked.  Got CK3 yesterday and last night I managed to unify the kingdom of Ireland! Now  what to do about that pesky mayor...
2127,Obligatory “I’m sorry”. Which I am. I wanna give you kudos though. From what you shared you not only kept it together while you were there  but you also weren’t bullied into things like not being around for your new child. I know the industry is hard enough to get into and again I am sorry that you wound up getting fired. You can hold your head up high long term though and a lot of people would’ve been too scared. Also  the fucking awareness to not try and ride the games industry’s “Me Too”? You’ve got some real grace imo. I wish you the best and encourage you  if you haven’t and feel comfortable  to reach out to journalists about your experience.

2129,There 100% is a learning process there. It’s far more difficult to read code then to write it so if you are able to copy a good sized project  can understand all of the code present  and successfully alter all of it to meet what your game actually does and is with its changes (which I’m assuming is a fair amount) then I think you’ll learn a ton there.  Using examples that other people have isn’t cheating it’s just to allow you to have a working example to reference as you make the revisions yourself.  That said if you do use a large sized open source project as a base I would heavily recommend you to credit the owner of said project as he did provide that base for you to move forward from.
2130,Spelunky 2 is coming to Steam next Tuesday! Unfortunately  we decided not to release with online co-op enabled - that way we can improve it without delaying the release. The upside is that when we add it back  it will have cross-play with PS4!

Anyway  I’ve been wanting to get a new PC for some time now  my one is awful as it constantly crashes  so I’ve been looking around and (I think) I’ve found a decent one. So I thought as I’m getting a new PC  why not get a triple monitor setup  I’ve always fancied one  but I just want to make sure that 1. This PC will support a triple monitor setup (ie will the graphics card be fine) 2. Will the monitors be able to connect to the PC (ie the cables) 3. Will the monitors be able to be mounted via this VESA mount. 4. Will the monitors be good for gaming. If anyone has a better suggestion I’m more than happy to hear it. Thanks! :)

2134,Everyone has a light bar too - fuckin 15 year old mini van is fully kitted out with led lights and blinding me  I'll take underglow over the stupid distracting blinking brake lights - especially in stop and go traffic
2135,In the 70's and 80's street racing was extremely popular in my city. At the Nathans thousands would show up. Even using the under construction parkways to race. There's a 5 part uploaded video from someone who was there  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTB7VQ0XBhY
2136,"Understand that Jeep owes you nothing.  They *may* extend some courtesy assistance to you  but are certainly under no obligation to do so. If you're not adversarial with them (e.g. approaching them as if you're ""fighting Jeep on their warranty"") you might have better luck.  You're owed nothing. You might get lucky  but probably not with that attitude."
2137,I often see similar misinformation about the content of 5e books as well. My general conclusion is that most people talking about them haven't actually read them.  However I would think it's fair to say that the type of balance and design goals for the balance DnD recommends have changed over the years.
2138,Hey    So recently I was asked to DM a D&D one shot for a few friends. I suck at one shots and had only 2 hours to prepare  so I came up with a story where the players had to investigate old ruins  where they discovered that an old goddess is still there but she is afraid to the outside world because thousands year ago someone killed all her worshippers and she went mad too. So she became evil and bla bla they had to end her suffering and killed her (she had almost no power because of all the loosing worshippers thing and stuff).   The problem is that for some unholy reason the players loved the game so much  that they asked me to continue this. I kinda left a plot hook that there were three artefacts created by the goddess and one of them was missing from the ruins (other two they used to open the goddesses temple and to fight her). Also there were hints that the goddess might have been created by some mysterious figure a long time ago. But now I am completely stuck and have some kind of blockade. Nothing I can think of makes sense and I'm unable to write anything nice to continue this.   Do you maybe have any ideas on how could I continue this? The party discovered who killed the worshippers  so that's a dead end :/
2139,Pretty happy to see *Adachi and Shimamura* doing well. I thought it would be far less popular than this  although it was only the premiere so we'll see whether it remains so or not.  I'm also surprised Akudama Drive isn't higher. I suppose if people are only going by the synopsis it doesn't sound that appealing.
2140,I just idle my truck and let it get to temp every couple weeks and then do a few drives back and forth on my longish driveway  equivalent to around the block I guess. It gets the fluids moving around and that is about all I am looking for before it goes back in the barn.                             IMO no amount waiting for it to be dry will keep the salt off it if you take it onto actual roads at speed.
2141,"I can't understand how people will only buy a car that is made by a certain manufacturer. I also always see this amongst German car owners  people that own a Mercedes say they'll ""never get a BMW"" and vise-versa. I've noticed this amongst enthusiasts too  and I just don't get why. Why can't people just look past the badge and appreciate cars for what they are?"
2142,Depends on the system. Mutants & Masterminds 3rd edition? Heck yes and even then you still might have problems.  Dungeons and Dragons 5e? *Kinda.* There are certain Tiers of play that require being a certain level. A level 4 character is going to feel vastly weaker compared to a level 7 character. While at the same time a level 5 character and a level 8 character can be in the same party without much of a problem. Abilities also come online at different points for different classes which tilts the balance a bit.  A level 20 cleric could keep 3 level 5 characters alive easily without crippling the game (from a mechanical perspective)  but I doubt it would be fun for the other players.  In my home games I try keeping pc levels within 5 of each other.
2143,Purely based on numbers  according to SimilarWeb [Jalopnik pulls in about 7.2M pageviews](https://imgur.com/a/IMRfVi2) a month  a far cry from when I remember EIC PG say they hit something like 22M pageviews one month. Jalopnik is a big ship to sink  thousands of posts  many evergreen. They've been around longer and have more internet clout  domain authority if you will. 7M views is a lot but not glory day numbers. Also explains their downsizing.  TheDrive is crushing it sort of with twice as many page views  but they have a lot of work to do.  Jalopnik has a better bounce rate at 60 percent  meaning visitors click on something else. TheDrive is around 90 percent  not good. Jalopnik also has a longer engagement rate  they stick around longer  good for advertisers.  TheDrive also has more resources obviously. I saw they pay their weekend writers $2500 a month compared to Jalopnik's $1500/month (a little bird told me.)  It's weakened David Vs. Goliath. Still pulling in thousands in revenue a day. And not dead just my .02

2145,"MSI has done shady things in the past.   After reading all the available evidence  I am leaning towards ""MSI is being scummy  again  in new ways.""  In this case  I would need to put down my pitchfork first. This bullshit could be very well greed and/or incompetence. If Nvidia cancels MSI  good  they need a good beating for being habitually scummy.   If I wanted to doompost  I could be saying that Starlit Partners would be in cahoots with the MSI US branch  probably."
2146,You know  I just got a 4k TV a month ago. First 4k monitor is on its way. I can't even imagine 8k - I've seen one of the Samsung 8k's in person and it doesn't seem like that big of a jump to me. As a really slow adopter  I'm going to wait until real HDR and VRR are improved at 4k before thinking about dipping my toes in 8k. Pushing 8k makes sense for the manufacturers  but as a consumer -- I don't feel like being an early adopter. To me  it's like going from 144hz to 240hz - objectively better  but is it worth it for me?
2147,Comfort and what you know  mostly.   &#x200B   My family was solely Honda for the longest time until my dad bought a Toyota and then they slowly transitioned. I  myself  have never had the same brand car out of the 4 cars that I've owned (Honda  Toyota  Subaru  Infiniti).
2148,My fiance has had an 06 for the past 5 years that's now got 180k on the odometer. It's the perfect city/commuter car.  We've never gotten under 30mpg on a tank. It's big enough inside to haul a decent amount of stuff but small enough outside to be able to park almost anywhere. And even though it's only got 100ish hp  it's fun to drive.
2149,So I’m in the minority in this I guess  but I don’t see a problem with battle passes. If you can earn the credits to unlock them while also getting the first 6 characters free  im not sure what the outrage on this is. I get this isn’t the avengers game everyone wanted but I enjoy the gameplay and being a live service type grind game with a battle pass makes sense.
2150,This def seems like a move to hype up Game Pass rather than make all these titles exclusive. That would go against basically the last 2.5 years of marketing “for the players” that Xbox has been all about - against exclusivity.
2151,Blood pressure and resting pulse are easy to track at home and can be used as indicators of your fitness level. Oxygen saturation can be checked at home as well  although that one tends to be pretty boring unless you have a lung condition (by the time your oxygen saturation drops below normal  you need to be in a hospital).
2152,`df.style.background_gradient(“Blues”)`  to visualize your data frame in the given color map (“Blues” in this example) in Jupyter notebook  It can also be done on a subset of columns or with specified max and min values.  More infos in: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17/generated/pandas.core.style.Styler.background_gradient.html
2153,it's just so hypocritical after how they're handling games on their platform and making devs go exclusive with them. Apple/Google are doing the same thing  yet epic is fighting them while doing the exact same thing.
2154,I'm biased because I really enjoyed the game but [Akash Thakkar's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_haRMbKZ1M) about Hyper Light Drifter was fun  and informative. He talks about working remotely  and the odd instruments and process he uses to make sounds for the game.
2155,3080 will be cool jump from RX570/GTX1060 that I currently own. Can't wait to play some games.  That said  is it possible to undervolt or adjust power limit slider on the RTX 3000 cards? I prefer 90% performance for way lower temps and noise levels.
2156,Since I started playing RPGs four decades ago:  Me: I’m thinking of running a D&D campaign...  Friend: Cool! I want to play a dwarf cleric!  Me: ...with this set of races & classes customized for my setting.  Friend: 🙁  Substitute any system & the options from the core books. Sure  people get over the disappointment  but I’ve found that if you aren’t going to allow all the options from the core books  it is best to start the conversation talking about the setting. That way people don’t start to get their hopes up for something that doesn’t fit the setting.  The other side is that I’ve generally learned that I’m happier when I let a system be itself. I’m a lot more willing to bend my setting to meet the system than I used to be.
2157,>I’ve heard Samsung’s new 8nm process yields are trash  I haven't seen many expressing opinions about yields  nvidia cut-down their chips heavily anyway to not really bother with the defect rates.  More importantly  their chips on 8nm seem to be hitting a clockspeed ceiling of 2Ghz requiring lots of power when they're already doing 2GHz easily 4 years before.
2158,Do I need to watch The Irregular at Magic High School before watching the currently airing The Irregular at Magic High School: Visitor Arc or are they completely different storylines? On MyAnimeList(MAL) it said that the latter is a prequel to the original series but I just wanted confirmation from people who have actually watched it.
2159,I saw a tweet mentioning how the [Scikit-Learn algorithm cheat sheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) needed to be updated. One of the reasons was that SVMs were still on there and that they would rarely be deployed. What's your experience with/take on that? I was under the impression that they can often be very useful still.
2160,"Everyone I know who is good is basically a big kid messing around on a laptop so don't worry about it. In terms of ""productionizing"" code  I think of that as basically imagining that the code is never going to run on your laptop and start from there. Can you get it running in the cloud somewhere? Can you easily redeploy it in that case? People aren't going to use your code by clicking play on vscode so how are they going to interact with it? Does it work if more than one person is using it at a time? Could it scale up and how would that work. Have you hardcoded loads of stuff that people may need to be configurable  from a Web frontend maybe? Does it run on loads of files on your laptop and maybe should it get data into it in some other way? It's all about taking the core of what you have and wrapping it."
2161,there should be proper way for pcb designer to choose right capacitor  should not limited by people who don't really know about the capacitor and pcb design. as both mlcc and poscap type has its own pros and cons  that means both not suitable for all work. for example how can people who animadvert poscap can explain how does graphic card work from PCIe slot to screen?
2162,Not to discredit OP or his experience  but I have a good friend that is at the Ubisoft SF studio. Not a dev  but I will say most of what OP talks about doesn't necessarily have to do with his experience developing (aside from the last bullet- deadlines) but more office politics. I have heard nothing but good experience from her. YMMV no matter the company and it will mostly come down to the studio.  That aside  I'm sorry about your experience OP. I hope you find a company/studio that works for you. I've been there.
2163,One of my coworkers is a statistician (holy shit i spelled it correctly) and uses R. He is currently lead for building a ML tool in Python. Maybe it's because python can be rolled into full blown apps easier? Idk... I don't do R
2164,"Most of the ""bugs"" in D&D are either playstyle differences or  even more commonly  people discovering that if you go out of your way to break the game  with that much surface area *of course* you can break it.  There is no game in existence as complex as D&D that you can't ""break"" in similar ways if that's your goal.  And it's arguable whether these things are really ""broken"" - that depends on what your goal is. One of the most common criticisms of modern D&D is that it has such a focus on a certain kind of balance. If you don't think that this kind of balance is important  or even think it might be counterproductive to many styles of play  they're not bugs at all."
2165,So i bought this pc https://www8.hp.com/gr/el/desktops/product-details/34111446 and when in idle the cpu temp is around 45 with a little trip to 50 degrees which i believe is fine im worried tho when i play warzone it stays most of the time around 75 but it hits 81 for like a second and then drops again at 67 where it goes up again.Is this something to worry about or are this temps fine?I do have the stock cooler and the case doesnt have that good of an airflow  AMD Ryzen™ 5 3500  GTX 1660 6 gb
2166,You're kinda looking at it from the wrong angle.  For the purposes of this discussion I'm going to ignore factors like drivetrain losses  weight transfer  and cornering dynamics in relation to driven wheels because that would make this a lot longer and I think it's a little beyond the scope of the question.  &nbsp   When it comes to straight line acceleration alone  it doesn't matter one bit which wheels send the power down to the road... As long as those wheels have enough grip  they can use all of the power being sent to them to act on the road and move the car forward.  It doesn't matter if a total of 200hp is being sent to just the rear  just the front  or all four wheels  so long as all 200hp can be applied to the road.  &nbsp   So why ever drive more than just one wheel?  The answer is  each individual tire can only handle a certain amount of torque being pushed through it before it breaks traction with the road surface and you get wheelspin  after which you're no longer efficiently using the power at hand.   The more wheels you can split the power between  the more total amount of power you can handle before you encounter wheelspin.  &nbsp   But it's important to remember that do long as you're not encountering wheelspin when accelerating in a straight line  it **doesn't really matter where the power is coming from**. That's why AWD's advantages begin to fade at speed  where the torque being applied to the road surface is lower and it's harder to break traction.
2167,I think the game has settled on a weird sense of balance that the numbers must be the same. Because of that  ever since 3ed  non spell casters just haven't been able to keep up.   now for encounter balance? Sometimes running away is the encounter!
2168,"In shinsekai yori there are several kids with some sort of mental disorder  not main focus  Accel world mc is suffering from very low self esteem  sort of relevant to the story  Aku no hana  the girl mc is sadistic  relevant to the story  Angel beats  disability  not main focus  Anohana  mental disorder  unresolved grief  so bad that it impairs normal life  sort of relevant to the story  Black bullet  the poor girls have too many problems...

2169,I still remember when a blogger criticized the Model X in a review back in 2017 or so  which somehow was brought to the attention of Musk  who demanded that the said blogger order to be canceled.   Yes  he's probably one of the most petty person to sit as a CEO of any company.   This move should come as no surprise  since any news about Tesla is pretty much guaranteed to only be positive  least Lord Musk brings down his wrath on critics.
2170,"Data storytelling is a skill - it is by no means required of all data science roles  nor is it even required in all data science career paths.  Generally speaking  if you are part of a data science function that supports decision makers  you are more likely to need to brush up on your storytelling. But let's call it what it is - you need to learn to turn data into a compelling reason why someone should/shouldn't do something.  It's not about *actually* writing a story. The ""story"" can be three  really good bullet points in an email. The story can be one really good slide. And the story sometimes needs to be a 20 minute presentation that you pitch in front of senior  non-technical leadership. In the end  your goal is to influence people  and how you do that is what shapes your storytelling.  So which roles do not require storytelling? In general  roles where you are building products (as opposed to delivering insights) are less likely to require storytelling *on the part of the data science team*. The product management team will normally be the one responsible for that.  Now  the issue with all of this is that to advance in a data science career into management (or into high level individual contributor roles)  you are once again going to need to tell stories - albeit in this case it will be about telling stories of *why* you should do things (i.e.  advocating for projects  strategy  etc.)"
2171,"* Despite the way everyone talks about ""Dungeons & Dragons"" like the thing they're doing is the Real Way of doing it  despite a series of expensive rulebooks  there's no single game called ""Dungeons & Dragons"". Try to understand this particular game. * There's no wrong way to play  but there are games that aren't for you and groups that don't quite mesh. * It's okay to politely bow out if you're not having fun. * It's okay to not enjoy playing with particular people whose company you otherwise enjoy  you can find other ways to hang out with them. * Everyone in the group is responsible for entertaining one another  it's not just the GM's job. * The whole ""only being able to act on what your character would actually know"" thing is actually pretty unfun. It's way better to pay attention to information your character isn't present for and arrange creative twists for how your character gets involved later. * Secrets kept from the other players are generally way less fun than you'd think. It's way better to share and to trust the other players to act on their characters being in the dark. * ""What my character would do"" gets used an excuse to be a dick to other players kind of a lot. * Figure out if you've got someone's consent before you drag their character into something that might be unfun for them to play  regardless of what the rules let you do. * People are more important than the game."
2172,I think the crunchiest I’ve *played* would probably be what I think was a Hero/Champions/Ars Magica mash-up. It felt like there was a lot of modifier and target number calculation that I could never quite figure out.
2173,"I don't like Dungeons & Dragons.  Most of my experience is with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 or Pathfinder 1. These are very complex  but not very thematic.  I am multiply disabled  and I prefer playing characters who share some  not all  but some of my disabilities. So I much prefer games with more disability options  and which discuss whether and how to balance these.   If I'm playing a fantasy campaign  I'd like miracles and divine magic to feel like miracles. I'd like great ones to inspire new callings  pilgrimages  or in some religions sacrifices to give thanks. But in Dungeons & Dragons it feels like arcane magic with the useful option to substitute healing spells for others.  If I'm not playing a fantasy campaign  half the classes  and all the spell lists  are useless.  In any DnD campaign  more experienced characters get a lot more hit points. A lot of the time  higher-level characters can shrug off ordinary dangers. I know I'm supposed to accept the abstraction  but I don't understand it well enough to accept it. It's unrealistic  it adds bookkeeping  and when we add the different types of damage resistance and damage reduction  it can be complicated too.  There's often a trade-off between fast  simple  and realistic  but Dungeons & Dragons often says ""how about none""?"
2174,"So to nobody's surprise the Student council pres was indeed Setsuna Yuki. I usually dislike it when a show has the whole ""hiding who you are/pretending to be someone else"" thing. But Who knows  maybe it isn't that bad here. I'm assuming it's probably because of her family not supporting the idea of doing idol stuff or something along those lines."
2175,My wife and I want to move to the east coast  either NYC or Boston.  We both work already work at big companies on the west coast and decided that we would be happier closer to family and friends on the east coast.     I'm a data scientist with 2.5 years of experience  and I'm surprised how difficult it is to get a data science job or data engineering job even with work experience.    Does anyone have any advice if our primary goal would be getting any job as soon as possible as we move?  I don't necessarily care about having the coolest job anymore  just something stable as I move to an area where I prefer to live.
2176,I went through 4 reviews that had both TUF and Gaming X Trio. TUF was usually 10C cooler while being 0-1 Db louder. Considering TUF is also much cheaper I think it's fair to assume that MSI botched their RTX release.  TUF with quiet bios seems to be both cooler and quieter than Trio.
2177,Once games are shown to be making effective use of the speeds. That might be as soon as the launch of PS5  it might not be for years. Probably the latter  developers may need to radically rethink how they load assets or otherwise leverage the drive.

2179,"Accelerator from the Index/Railgun series might fit in with being a cool action character with an f-u attitude (I've only watched A Certain Scientific Accelerator  which was a bad idea  I should have started from the beginning.) [Appare-Ranman!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40532/Appare-Ranman) was [linked in this super-popular post a couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/j04bk9/beautiful_martial_arts_hand_to_hand_combat/?utm_medium=) and looks pretty awesome although I've yet to check that one out myself. [Promare](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35848/Promare) is a recent movie that's supposed to share a lot in common with Gurren Lagann (I also haven't seen it yet  it's on my watchlist.) [Goblin Slayer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37349/Goblin_Slayer) is pretty great if you don't mind certain graphic themes.  Also [Inferno Cop](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16774/Inferno_Cop) is a really good qualifier.

It's also one of the funniest things I've ever watched.  Hope you find some shows you enjoy! If you end up checking any of those out I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. :-)"
2180,I’m looking at a 2008 Lexus GS460 Sport Luxury for 15k USD. Seems like a good deal  but I worry about running costs and such for a 12 year old car that was 92k brand new (at least here in Australia.)  What do you guys think?
2181,I know in Europe Mercedes and BMW are way more common than they are in the United States  where here MB (until the CLA/A Series came out) was perceived purely a luxury auto group. If they want to move upmarket (move *back* upmarket)  they can't have a $300 000 car next to a $30 000 car. It might be great for sales and no one cares that they are driving the cheapest MB out there  but for me at least  they've lost prestige and brand power. Instead of seeing a couple of very nice luxury cars  every millennial professional has a lease special CLA with a cracked bumper talking about how much they love being a MB person... Brand identity is a thing. Luxury auto manufacturers should not race to the bottom to chase sales they don't need.   and BMW and MB have diluted their brand so much here in the United States.
2182,Adrift and alone in an escape pod flotating in an empty region of space. No transponder  no radio  no way for anyone to find you. Then you hear a knock on the airlock hatch.   Watching from the ground as a comet flies by. Then another. And another  soon the whole sky is filled with comets.   An astronomer discovers a new star very close to earth. You’re pretty sure it wasn’t there before.
2183,>Yeah  a turbo will get you way more power  but it will be more expensive  add lag  and require tuning.  Eh  the 90's called and it wants its talking points back. Everything requires tuning  and price is pretty much a wash at this point thanks to China perfecting the art of ripping off older turbo designs. Even lag is not really an issue if you select a properly sized turbo.   The only downside to turbo systems that still exists is the complexity of the plumbing.   To answer your question though  think about the total addressable market for these supercharger kits - you're chasing a niche within a niche. Using the BRZ as an example  they sell a few thousand of those a year. Maybe a few hundred of those owners will actually follow through on purchasing a supercharger kit for it (and not just blab about it on the internet). So you're doing a ton of R&D and production ramp-up to sell *maybe* 1 000 kits over a few years? That sounds like a terrible business decision to me...
2184,The players don't know how much or how little information is behind the screen. Don't be afraid to improvise something  take a moment to 'check your notes' while you think it over  then just let it play out. Just write down anything you make up on the spot.  And a good trick I like doing (which I've stolen from other  better GMs) is to get the players to recap the last session themselves. Offer a small bonus of some kind (like a chance to reroll one die roll that game) to the person who volunteers  then once they've recapped ask the others if there's anything else.  Not only does this act as a reminder to you about what happened  it tells you what the players focused on most and remember best.
2185,Surprised that worked. The time traveller never indicated that in a crisis they couldnt go back in time again. I suppose the real questiom never answered was can you go back in time while back in time.
2186,I had an Amiga and commodore 64.before apple and windows computers were very basic. The commodore used a cassette tape to store data on. I played games and used the Amiga for video editing. Amiga was made by commodore. Computers did not become a thing until Microsoft came out with windows. MS Dos was hard to use. I hope this helps.
2187,Basically something like berserk.  I did love the chimera ant arc in hunter x hunter as well even though there was no romance so romance is only optionnal.  I tried claymore and thought it was fine.  I loved the film patema inverted.  I dropped out of rezero season 2 after loving season 1 but failing to get invested in the mystery after 10 episodes of the 2nd season. I am also feeling like dropping out of higurashi after 21 episodes because i am also getting tired of the mystery and the time loops as well. (please don't hate me)  Does anyone have any gem shows that is a fantasy that is quite dark and that is a complete adaptation with many a bit of romance. I kind of like that mix of genres.   I want to get out of that slump  please help me find what i'm looking for.
2188,Just keep changing the oil every 4 thousand miles. Keep an eye on your brake pads and tire tread. Make sure the air filter is clean. It's a Toyota. As long as you keep clean oil in it will run run forever.

2191,I wouldn't worry about performance at this point. Do it this way.  1. Pick up the way which is logically correct and go with that 2. If you find there is a problem with performance  then optimize 3. If you optimize  then use a profiler to find the bottleneck. Many times the bottleneck is in the places you would never think about.
2192,"I saw one of these in Albania with Kosovo plates... Don't even want to know what that owner was involved in.  It looked so out of place compared to all of the multiple decades-old Mercedes and I can't imagine driving it on Albania's ""road"" network."
2193,In the last five years the only new titles that left a mark on me was this show  Run with the Wind and Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju. Whenever I see a clip of these shows some of the emotions I felt when I was watching the shows would come rushing back in.
2194,Whether you're currently working as a data scientist  searching for a role  or building a leadership team  what do you expect from a data science leader? By leader I mean someone who directly manages a team of data scientists?
2195,"Typical data science project:  Collect data -> Preprocess data -> Modeling/analysis -> Evaluation -> Interpretation -> Business value  People insist on focusing on the modeling/analysis when it's only a small part of the entire process.  What matters more than using fancy algorithms is whether the data you're collecting is actually useful for anything  whether the preprocessing you're doing is beneficial and whether your interpretation of the results lead to ""actionable insights"" and deliver business value.  Traditional simple approaches like GLM's make interpretation easy and force you to do proper preprocessing. Easy interpretation -> more actionable insights -> more business value.  It's usually not the accuracy % of your model that delivers business value  most of the time it's the interpretation of that model that leads to some insights.  There have been some statistics thrown around that only 3-5% of models are actually deployed in production to do prediction. Some are obviously stuck in limbo due to no engineering skills and some are failed projects  but the overwhelming majority were never intended to go into production. They're ""write once  run once"" type of ad-hoc analysis."
2196,I beat that game on the switch over last summer . Despite some FPS drops  and some weird things that got patched out later I don’t know why it got as much hate as it got  yeah I played it on Pc and it looks way cleaner than switch. But I still had a good time with the switch version.
2197,People have been making games on 8bit computers and pocket calculators. Your Macbook Air might struggle with high quality graphics and intensive physics calculations  but you don't have to use them for learning. 3D games are running on phones nowadays and a lot of them are probably made in Unity. In general  nothing is really all that resource intensive ... unless you make things that take a lot of resources. As a beginner  you won't.  Unity is a great engine to start in. Lots of learning material out there. Can do many things out of the box. Just download it  try a few example projects and see if they run ok on your Macbook.   Another advantage of using Unity is that it uses C# as its scripting language. C# is somewhere in the middle between very abstract languages like Python where you write a few lines of code and you are done and languages like C++ where you have to spell everything out manually. That way you'll learn all the basic programming concepts. You also don't have to compile your code for several minutes to try out your changes ... so iteration and trial and error are sped up greatly.  Mostly  don't worry about what programming language to learn. If you ever need to learn other languages  the general concepts are the same. Since game development is a field where performance is important  languages like C# or C++ are preferred  because they are just much faster than Python for example.
2198,This was a super insightful and well constructed post.  PCMR suffer from the Dunning–Kruger effect. We spend 5 mins trying to learn something and then massively overestimate our ability. Thanks for taking the time to write this.
2199,20th anniversary edition V:tM  it's the metaplot agnostic edition: [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/94815/Vampire-The-Masquerade-20th-Anniversary-Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/94815/Vampire-The-Masquerade-20th-Anniversary-Edition)
2200,It looks very promising  but reading the paper  I see that an RTL design was only used to evaluate the size overhead on the TSMC 65nm node. All of the IPC claims and perf improvements seem to be measured by a cycle-level GPU simulator. To me that indicates they didn't account for the real constraints this would impose on a chip?  I assume that creating a mesh interconnect encompassing almost the entire area and running at half the core clock has implications for the entire GPU. It would be interesting to see this realized in a product  but the IPC gains are probably a theoretical  best-case scenario?  I'd love to get a smarter person's take on this.
2201,A lot of newer players expect every encounter to be tailored to their level / party  so they don't even consider the better part of valor.   I wouldn't say its your fault.  Just make it clear that some foes may be beyond the party's capabilities.
2202,As a person who works in an industry with crunch and also a person who has experienced crunch more than once  I say this with sincerity. Even though CD Projekt are paying their staff accordingly this is still not cool in my opinion. Every single person that reads this comment knows that every single person on this planet has a finite amount of time on this earth  some things are worth more than money.
2203,I’m trying to make a turn based 2d rpg. It would be similar to pokemon in terms of top down perspective but I want to make a more in depth combat system. What would you guys suggest I use as an engine? I’m willing to learn any engine I just want to make sure the one I pick would not limit design and is good for 2d.
2204,I was put forward to help with this a few weeks ago. Bloody grateful to stay out of this mess. I read somewhere else they ran out of columns. If they're running out of columns in Excel it raises serious serious questions about the integrity of everything they're doing.

2207,The most important game that actually is tied to the brand of a console is not coming with it? I still might go with Xbox but they needed to make this the top priority in Microsoft. What the hell are they even doing? They're not making Windows 10 any better. Their support still sucks hard and deep. They're not making any other major games. They are just buying more games for game pass which is great but what do they even do with their day at Microsoft?
2208,Im gming my own fantasy setting using Reign's Company rules and my own custom d10 (may change it to original reign system if anyone recommends  but I cant afford the original book  I have enchiridion.) So one of my players has a minor noble title which includes a small village/homestead but also she is the founder and ruler of warrior's guild in the capitol of the same small kingdom. So  I dont understand how this should work  does she have two companies  (village of xxxx and xxxx guild) or one merged company (noble house of xxxx). I believe merging them is not a good idea since they are entirely different despite of having the same leader. I maybe wrong tho. Any advise?

Across a variety of ray-traced and rasterized DirectX and Vulkan titles  the GeForce RTX 3070 delivers similar or faster performance than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (which sold for twice the price) and is on average 60% faster than the original GeForce RTX 2070.
2210,Microfiber towels. You get what you pay for. 4 good ones are better than a dozen cheep ones.   Any of the car shampoos at the auto store will work fine.   I love Klass All-In-One as a sealant. Klass actually sells a sealant  but until you have a polisher and some experience it will be too hard to work with.  The all in one product goes on and comes off easily.
2211,"I already had some self-taught programming experience in C  C++  VB.net and HTML/Javascript  and from the career advice I got early on in my career it was a lot easier to get accepted by the software engineering community without a CS degree than to be accepted by the stats community without a stats-adjacent degree.  When I was starting out my career there wasn't much of a Data Science ""starter"" career path  so it was a weird orthogonal career progression into either stats/data analysis or IT/systems analysis  until I was sufficiently ""proven"" on both career tracks to have an employer take a risk on hiring me on for a hybrid position.  The last 10 years have been a weird career progression  and there was a noticeable uptick in recruiters banging my door once I hit the 3-5 year experience mark."
2212,I’ve read every comment. But it’s late and I’m a dumbass. Regarding the efficiency of power to performance  should I be buying this if I have a 2070 non super? Am I going to see a massive upgrade like nvidia led me to believe?
2213,"Yes for three reasons.  1. Controllers are the more laid back and relaxed method of input.       You can literally lean back while playing which is much less conveniently possible with keyboard and mouse.       Obviously this is a counter example for games that intend to be very tense and require 100% attention and focus. E.g. highly competitive games. But a lot if not most genres benefit from focusing on offering the experience in a more relaxed way.  2. Focusing on keyboard first prevents smooth console launches.       This may be irrelevant to your title but if you do not consider this from the beginning you drastically increase the cost of ever making it happen (designing an entirely new input scheme and integrating it into every aspect of your game is expensive).   3. Player expectations.      Even though you can argue that your indie title won't ship on consoles players expect certain forms of input and interaction. Your game doesn't exist in a vacuum and you need to cater to your audience who are probably aware of the massive amount of titles that launch cross platform.      Forms of input have been designed across lots of years now to accommodate this.      As relatively small title you will have a very hard time defying user expectations forcing you to retrain your players in an extended tutorial and risking people feeling uncomfortable due to the change and never coming back to your title once they dropped it (possibly mid playthrough) because adapting back to your ""weird"" scheme is a challenge and not within their muscle memory anymore.  We saw genres take massive dives in popularity due to being incompatible with controller inputs (e.g. RTS) and other genres grow and thrive as result of it.  Conversion from a controller layout to a PC layout is just a lot easier. Not everything can be replicated smoothly but all can be done relatively ok with a relatively small amount of effort.   Whereas the other way around is a massive challenge.  Designing controller first is a deliberate decision that happened over time because it's easier and in the end better than the alternatives for a lot of cases and is now too common to ignore for established genres."
2214,Really cool story!   Not even close to the same but anyway. Dad used to be a Lancia dealer so I bought three Lancia Thema 88s and restored one really nice from them for my fathers 70th birthday. He was really happy but never drove the thing since it really is an old boring shitbox. So we sold it after a couple of years.
2215,Under steady cornering (neither accelerating or slowing) the cars behavior is determined by suspension geometry  chassis balance  weight distribution and grip.  Factory cars are setup to slightly understeer.  You don't have to be at (or near) the limit of traction to feel the difference!   Steady cornering at normal road speeds then accelerating in a fwd will 'push' the cars line wider and lifting off will tighten the cars line.   A rwd car will do the opposite.  The reason for this is when turning *the rear wheels travel a shorter distance than the front wheels*   A full time 4wd car will behave like a rwd OR fwd car depending on the geometry  chassis balance & weight distribution - infact the same car can do either depending on how the tyres are loaded (as an example if you turn in slightly too much and load the front tyres a lot getting on the power will make the car understeer and run wide  but if you lift off and transfer weight to the front  then get on the power the car will tighten it's line)
2216,It's also not necessarily the title but the responsibilities of the positions that overlap. Data Scientists should know how to put projects into production and write Pythonic/readable code - both of which should be known by data engineers or SEs
2217,Hello   I am currently working in accounts payable but have been teaching myself SQL/Python/HTML through CodeCademy pro. I've burned through all available courses there  and have been speaking with the data analyst manager at my company. I did a project for him but its clear that I need a deeper understanding of data science. CodeCademy gave me the tools to build a house  but I don't know how to put all of the materials together with those tools. I have a background in stats from college. I've been researching datascience boot camps as a way to solidify what I've already learned  as well as for the career/networking opportunities. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? From my research  FlatIron  Galvanize and metis all seem promising.
2218,“With support for Dolby Atmos® games at launch and Dolby Vision® games coming in 2021  the Xbox Series X and Series S will be the first consoles ever to enable gaming in both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos”.  “When you play in Dolby Vision  you unlock the most realistic and lifelike visuals the game has to offer  with brightness  contrast  color  and depth that goes beyond even traditional HDR games. Experience the world the way it was meant to be seen”.  “Up to 40x brighter highlights  10x deeper blacks (and up to 12bit Color Depth) bring fiery explosions and the deep void of outer space to life”.  “A leap beyond surround sound  Dolby Atmos puts you in the middle of the action by precisely placing each sound all around you in three-dimensional space  so you can quickly pinpoint its location in the game — before it's too late”.  “Activate Dolby Atmos for any headphones or unleash room-filling sound with a Dolby Atmos enabled TV  soundbar  or home theater”.  www.dolby.com/gaming/
2219,Mechanic here. Any modern car should be able to sit for a year or two or even longer with no problems other than the battery going dead. Even gasoline with high ethanol content shouldn't cause much of a problem. If people ask me how to store a car  I always tell them to disconnect the battery and put it on a trickle charger  and put the car up on jackstands to avoid flatspots on the tires. Overinflating the tires doesn't help all that much. Other than that  just leave the car alone. It will be fine. Even hybrids and EVs can sit for a year or two without the high voltage battery going dead. Just have to make sure the 12 volt battery is disconnected.
2220,All the other reviewers are praising the TLX and yet they’re the only one who seems to hate it. They seem to be super nit picky about this car especially.   My main person to look at reviewer is Alex on Auto so I don’t really have too much info on TSS but looking at their reviews  they have a clear bias to Korean cars.   That aside  which reviewers are your favorite?
2221,I'm a data scientist at a B2B SaaS company (sales/operations  not product)  and we are struggling to come up with impactful projects. It seems to me that data science is more applicable in the B2C space because of the large numbers of customers (we have about 10 000).  Some of the projects we've done:  Account Scoring  Whitespace Identification  Sales Rep Success Prediction  Anybody have any ideas as to how we could provide more value?
2222,Extremely disappointed with 3090. Bought 2080Ti and was happy overall. With £1500 for a GPU  will see what the kingpin offers. If its crap then will wait for AMD. £800 vs £1500 for 15%+ performance? GoTakeFreshOrangesHarry

2224,GranTurismo!  I have one  it looks like a corvette  but has a much sleeker body and a back seat. Also they were made during the time Ferrari owned half of Maserati....so they also have the 460hp 4.7L Ferrari V8 from the f430 in it! That’s why it sounds so good. Best car I’ve ever had. And they aren’t too expensive.
2225,AMD is out of touch with reality.  Price hiking the mainstream 6/8 core SKUs?  Meanwhile Sony and Microsoft are selling an 8-core Zen2 (with a few bits on top  like a GPU PSU Motherboard Cooler) for $300/400.  Plus  why did they remove the cooler on a 5800X? This essentially makes the price hike $100 as gamers would've preferred to use the stock cooler and move the savings into the GPU budget.  They just made sure people will keep buying the 3000 series.
2226,I hope it's not the future of PSU's as it just adds cost and complexity to motherboards  which you upgrade far more often than a PSU. Motherboards also have far shorter warranties  while good PSU's come with 10 year warranties.  This is not an upgrade or a solution  it's a trade-off.
2227,"ASUS has impressed me with their RTX 3080 TUF Gaming.  But that motherboard? I think it's not a ""mid-range"" X570 motherboard  looks more like a 700 - 800$ motherboard for extreme overclocking for Ryzen 5000 series.  On the other hand  their newly announced B550-E seems promising aesthetically  let's hope this ProCool solution for 14+2 power stages isn't just putting in numbers there. That might be one of the beefiest power stages that I see in B550 boards."
2228,Surprised Anandtech did not care to include a link to referenced blog. Here is the [post](https://medium.com/intel-tech/intels-commitment-to-gaming-and-a-sneak-peek-at-intel-technology-to-come-83677833be7f)  for anyone interested. Also interesting is that most of the post harps on how Intel is committed to gaming  and this coming a day before AMD's 'Where gaming begins' launch all but confirms that Zen 3 has made a significant stride forward in this department.
2229,My viewpoint: Translator between business and analytics  with a business understanding and technical understanding is a senior data scientist / lead data scientist role. Being able to ask the right business question and translate it into an analytics problem (involving predictive modeling or not) is definitely a DS role.  That’s my view point as a DS with 3 yoe in r&d consulting
2230,So basically it was as expected?  - Huge and unprecedented demand in demand due to the insane amount of hype on Ampere (rational or irrational) - Launch window supplies issues (as with all products thats any good)  Seems to me just a 1+1 > 2 situation where both factors played their hand in the situation we had yesterday. It clearly isn't a paper launch if most people GN talked to mostly agreed that simply is not the case.  But I have to agree with GN hear - If you feel extremely upset to not be able to buy the 3080 on day 1  chances are you have a lot more stuff to be upset about in life than a $700 GPU. Stocks clearly are there and will trickle in regardless base on what information GN has provided.

2232,Nana is the true protagonist  but Nanao isn't dead. You'll see more of him in a while. Do all the kids stay dead? Umm  I'm pretty sure for now only Nanao has survived his assassination  but I wouldn't be surprised if a few others also made it.
2233,"I would agree with them but hey  you like what you like. If you force yourself to watch ""good"" anime because others tell you to  then you probably arent going enjoy them as much as you should. Just continue watching whatever ""bad"" anime you enjoy and let your tastes evolve naturally"
2234,I am a Master's student and currently started a Data Science Internship  and the manager told me the reason he selected me for the intern and it was because I had 4 years if experience previously working with Oracle SQL  writing queries and extracting data  generating explain plans and analysing them to figure out the efficiency of the query  trying to optimize the query etc.   I used to think my experience with SQL and shell scripting would be useless  but your post and my manager's words comforted me that the experience may not exactly be useless.
2235,That's awesome. I did roughly the same thing but you got me beat on account of I didn't do many sequels  horror  and male idol shows. I went in with wanting to go from 27 and widdle it down to 10 but I think I've only dropped 3 (and I liked those 3  I just couldn't keep up that many anime) and am locked into to staying with 18 (also 6 haven't aired yet it why the math doesn't add up). Hopefully my job doesn't suffer this season. It's such a good season. Pretty stoked for it because I already like this season a ton more than last season.  Tonikawa  Sleepy Princess  and Majo no Tabitabi are my top 3 so far.
2236,Hello!  Someome [asked a similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/j7uepm/tolerable_dubbed_anime_to_watch_while_working_out/?utm_medium=) on r/AnimeSuggest the other day and I took my best shot at leaving a [comment (which I'll link here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/j7uepm/tolerable_dubbed_anime_to_watch_while_working_out/g87lbw8?utm_medium=) For the most part it depends on what kind of genres you're into (and it also kind of depends on how you'll be watching it  if it's retricted to Netflix/Hulu/Crunchyroll/Amazon Prime or whatever or if you're open to everything.) [Hunter X Hunter (2011)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011) might be a really good choice (I didn't mention that show on that other thread)  especially as a first anime  it's an action-adventure  has a great English dub  is kind of long (148 episodes) and has a great story  great characters  and a second-to-none power system. Also it's fairly easy to follow along with  and it isn't too inappropriate (some dude's butt shows on screen for like a scene or two and I think that's the extent of things  other than violence of course.)  Hope you find something you like!
2237,I feel like this is very underhyped SSD feature (compared to PCIe 4.0) that's right around the corner (I assume  since it's been months since the spec released) yet there's very very few information on when it will materialize for the average consumer (Kioxia seems to have launched NVMe 1.4 SSDs but for data center). Does anyone have any information on when we can expect them?  edit: The answer was  apparently  today (22/09  5 days later) at least in terms of paper launch. It also happens to be the world's fastest consumer SSD as of now  too  the [XPG S70](https://www.xpg.com/us/newslist/1/1/1905/). Hopefully now other SSD manufacturers follow suit.
2238,here in Oregon pickup sales have gone through the roof.    Everyone wanted to go camping this summer  since basically everything else was closed.  RV sales have gone through the roof  - coupled with temporary housing for homes lost in the fires - some RV lots are empty.    And everyone needs a truck to pull that trailer.  My wife's friend she went to high school with is a salesman with Hyundai and they cant sell sedans at all.  And more and more rental returns keep coming back
2239,One thing I really wished they did was hark back to the wood panels in some way since it made the original GW instantly recognizable. Yes large wood panels wouldn't work on a modern car  but even a thin wood strip on the side would actually make it stand out.
2240,I've had several day long interviews over the years.   Be prepared to go over your **elevator speech several times** mainly due the fact that many of them are meeting you for the first time. Therefore practice your **elevator pitch!**  Otherwise  they get boring pretty fast. I've found that you end up repeating yourself quite a bit. Everyone goes over the same high points (or lows) on your resume. Like automatons they ask the same set of questions  you'll notice. Who ever you interviewed with the first time (either via phone or the first round) will latch on to something they like and the word will spread then pretty soon you will be reciting that story 4-5 times.   Be happy that it is not live. When they took me out to lunch the bastards didn't stop peppering me with questions entire lunch. I could not eat more than a bite the entire meal.
2241,"I may have misread the answers and thus chosen incorrectly.  I read ""try different games"" as playing multiple systems which I'm not sure is the best way to becomes  an ""experienced GM"" for a given system.  If you want experience with a system you need to play that system although playing that system with different groups and trying different ""styles"" for that system are what will help you the most."
2242,"What you're describing is a leveraged position on the car. The intention of the long term is to entice you to borrow when you otherwise wouldn't. There's a much higher level of risk for the bank that you may not pay the full term of the loan  and a much higher risk on your part that you won't be able to  due to injury or loss of income. As such  interests rates tend to be ""lower"" but cumulatively higher  because you're most likely paying interest first. You'd be hard-pressed to find a loan that beats inflation."
2243,The fundamental issue with distance based  clustering is that you will get completely different results depending on how you scale each variable.  If you already know the true relative importance of each variable  then you're fine  More typically you don't ( which is why you are doing unsupervised learning)  and you cannot justify which scaling is correct  So just because you get a set of clusters with the default preprocessing is rather irrelevant... You would get a whole different set of clusters with a different perfectly valid scaling  In general I would say avoid clustering  ideally change the problem into a supervised learning problem.... ( and these typing things are pretty bogus  in general  aim is to justify marketing directors intuition)

2247,90s Japanese sedans such as the 1990-1993 Honda Accord  1989-1994 Nissan Maxima  Lexus LS400  and Infiniti Q45  and the 1992-1996 Camrys  lots of 90s Japanese sedans have aged well and are timeless  while American cars still had the boxy 70s look that still continued into the early 90s  Japanese cars back then looked like they could have been made in the late 90s to mid 2000s

2249,I think it’s important that you clarify if you need someone to do advanced research on data or someone to build production models. These are really two different skill sets. You may find some data scientists that have experience in both  but usually they have strength in one or the other.   If building production systems is your priority you want to find someone with a computer science background. This is really a Data Engineer.   If doing deep EDA and fitting highly custom models and using advanced statistical techniques is your priority  you need to find someone with a statistics background.   I’d figure out where the bigger need/skill gap currently exists and go from there.   Setting up end to end machine learning in a corporate environment typically takes a team of specialized experts  not just a single person.
2250,Hey everyone  I'm Matt and I've been a lifelong car guy who put his passion on hold for a while. I started a YouTube to motivate people like me to go out and wrench and build their dream car.

2252,Hi there   I was wondering if anyone would be able to discuss learning objectives and career outcomes for someone that is a newbie interested in the data science field. I recently applied for a graduate data analytics certificate on somewhat of a whim. I saw it as a great opportunity and with an application/ acceptance to a program  it would give me a chance to decide if this is for me.  I am intrigued by this field and believe it could be something I have a passion for. I am very experienced with Excel and proficient with SQL. Currently working in Supply Chain/ Inventory Managment  and can see the benefits of being a data expert.  Any insight into what resources are available for me to start getting my feet wet in this field? Or anything to look further into when determining if this is something I would enjoy? Where did you start your data science path? Would love to get on a call with someone if you are available.  Thank you in advance!
2253,Objectively is nothing.  If you want more immersive magic? Ars Magica.  If you want rules light? Lasers and Feelings.  If you want a deeper but more logical approach? Pathfinder 2.  Eldritch horror? Call of Cthulu.  If you like tables? Rollmaster.  My preference is Pathfinder 2.
2254,I was like in kindergarten. Stayed up till 2am flicking channels and stumbled upon Fooly Cooly. At the time I had zero clue what I was watching but it piqued my interest. Rewatched it years later and it's one of my favs.

2257,So I just started watching Black Clover. Does Asta grow out of the loud obnoxious phase? I’ve heard good things about Black Clover but man it’s kind of hard to watch with him constantly yelling and being annoying.
2258,Nvidia has been making arm based APUs for a while now.  They have the tegra chip that powers the Nvidia shield and Nintendo Switch  Also every smartphone since the first iPhone in 2008 has an arm based APU
2259,The DEEN anime rushed a lot of the chapters it covers from what I’ve heard. Just to throw this out there  the first chapter of the vn is free on steam and probably always will be. You can always try that out and see if you like the pacing better. Imo  the characters and their developement over time are the best parts of Higurashi. If they come across as barebones  then the DEEN anime failed.
2260,Still no confirmation if your digital library is transferring over.
2261,This looks really useful  I will definitely be looking into it. Is it easy to avoid data leakage between training and validation/test partitions? I'm fairly confident that any test partition should be excluded during imputation  and the same for validation partitions during cross validation.
2262,One of the big takeaways I have is that  with a couple exceptions  RTX 2080ti and RTX 3080 are firmly CPU bottlenecked at 1080p. And with many titles the CPU bottleneck could also be at 1440p.  If you're not using a 1440p 144Hz  or 4K monitor  RTX 3080 is not worth it. Simply because you'll be CPU limited  even if you already have the fastest CPU available.
2263,"Automotive engineer here. The answer is ""kinda"".  If what you want is an absolutely  100% new model  made from ""raw"" metal sheets and cast parts  built in the same exact way as it used to be  the answer is no. Most likely the tools (aka the whole production plant) have been gone and now there's some kind of new plant producing new cars there. Of course  as long as you still have all the original drawings/projects  you could theoretically rebuild the whole plant  but we're probably talking about hundred of millions of euros (or dollars) here  which is simply nonsense if we're talking of a small ""revival"" production.  The two alternative ways manufacturers use to ""make"" those ""brand new old cars"" you see sometimes are:  1) Deep restoration. Manufacturers  by having all the original documentation about the manufacturing process and maybe even by still having people who actually worked on the plants  have a massive knowledge ""advantage"" over a classic restoring workshop. If the car isn't too old (pre war stuff) and the car isn't too rare  they probably even have spare parts and so on. What they to is simply buy/recover some vehicle that is in a generally shitty state but has a good chassis (the only non replaceable and difficult to ""cleanly"" fix) and simply disassemble it to the bare chassis and reassemble it by replacing every worn out/broken part. For example  this is what Land Rover did (or still does?) When they sell you a ""brand new"" Range Rover Classic and  if I remember correctly  mercedes does offer similarly restored vehicles. Prices usually range from high five digits to low 6 digits  depending on the models.  2) Handmade rebuild. This is usually done for vehicles that were never produced in a production line  but were rather handbuild since the beginning. In this case it is possible to actually rebuild the car exactly as it used to be built in the past  since no big (and extremely expensive) production lines have to be set up  you just need someone that has the same skills as the men who used to build the car in the past and the simple tooling that was used to do so. This is what happened for example with the jaguar xkss a few years ago. Prices usually range from high 6 digits to 7 digits  and these examples are extremely rare  especially if you want a car that is exactly identical to the original and not some kind of ""lookalike but actually mechanically improved"" version of the original one."
2264,Hi Guys   I am a Bioinformatician looking to get into broader Data Science career. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how important is domain knowledge? Being a Bioinformatician I have a good knowledge of Biology/Healthcare but if I were to transition to a different domain say business analytics (in case I do not find opportunities in my domain) how much background knowledge should I get before applying to that job? Or do we learn on the job?  Thanks!
2265,So Ive been trying to run the documented Opacus code for a image classifier for the past few days and I'm unable to run the last few lines of code. My college project involves implementing it into a model but due to the lack of resources I'm pretty lost. Any experienced professionals who have worked with Opacus  can I ask for some of your time and some advice?  TIA!

2267,I’ve worked as both solely a DS and SWE at separate times for large companies but my preferred role is a hybrid at small companies.   Both are obviously extremely wide fields so there is definitely varying degrees of overlap. An example of my current position is that I work mostly on Python and Go backend APIs but I also handle all dashboarding and metric analysis for the team about our applications. So if we make changes what are the immediate impacts? What are the estimated impacts of something being faster/slower or more/less resource intensive if we expand at X rate. We have started recently implementing more NLP into our applications and through Elasticsearch so I have been working on creating custom models because our use case is domain specific.   I got my undergrad degrees in CS and Mechanical Engineering (I originally wanted to work with robots) and a Masters in CS with a concentration in DS. From my POV SWE skills are much easier to learn outside of the classroom compared to DS/math skills. If I knew I would end up where I am now in college I would definitely have swapped that ME degree for Applied Math or something similar.   All of that being said  I would try to round out your undergrad degree with mostly math/data science classes and maybe a few basic CS classes like data structures and algorithms at least and maybe an operating systems course too if possible. Then in your free time chose what type of SWE you would like to do and work on that.   As for internships  I tell our interns that anything is better than nothing and the more “practical” experience you can get before starting full time the better regardless of DS or SWE.

2269,Way to go. No matter what  you entered into a competition with people from all walks of life and nationalities. In other words  a world competition (at least that's what I understand Kaggle to be). Receiving any type of placement in a competition like that is worth sharing.

2273,With big data even something like storing it or taking a sum or taking an average is a huge task that takes a lot of effort and thought.  Big data is data science when the data is causing you big problems (it's arriving too fast  it's too big  it's too varied etc). A good estimate is that if you need more than 1 computer  it's big data.  Currently it's big data if it's 30+ terabytes. 2TB memory workstations with 128 cores and 16TB hard drives are a thing so it really takes a lot of data to actually **need** more than one computer.
2274,> My game communication interface currently uses websockets and engages a retry mechanism with message acknowledgement  so a message gets resent if the ack fails to arrive within a short period of time.  Are you doing this manually? WebSocket already implements this  so if you're doing it yourself on top you might actually be hurting yourself here.  As for synchronizing the state: the easiest way would be just to send the whole state every time there is an update. This is horribly inefficient  but for slow turn based games it probably doesn't matter much since you're only sending a single update every few seconds or so.  A step above that is to send just changes in state  relative to a known baseline. Again  since you're using WS/TCP here it's a bit easier since packets are always sent in-order and reliable. All you really need to do is send updates to the 'next' frame. It might be a good idea to add some snapshot counter on your client which updates along with every update  so in the event that a user disconnects  he can request the full state on reconnect. This can be done by checking the client's state num vs the server's state num. On connection  have the client send his last client state num  and if its different than (server's state - 1)  just send the whole game state.
2275,I'm a pretty new GM that started Pathfinder about 6 months ago with a new group. I have some RPG experience  but not much. I am running Curse of the Crimson Throne. My group really likes it.  To prepare  I read ahead to get a feel for what I have coming up. The. I go back and read the next next scenarios  taking notes. I go over the monster stat blocks and familiarize myself with the spells  feats  and abilities. I read over all the rules that I will need to run those encounters until I understand them. I just try to keep it small and only know what I need. Eventually  I learn it by using it in practice making it easier to remember. Currently  I'm learning the chase rules  because that's our next big encounter.   I try to familiarize myself with my player characters and how they work. I just don't know all of the ins and outs. If I have to I make a ruling and look it up after the session. I put it on my players to know their characters and how they operate.
2276,There are two for me. Twilight 2000 4e by Free League that just got Kickstarted  and the updated 2300 AD from Mongoose Publishing.   For TW 2000  I'm interested in the high production values  and being able to take the opportunity to introduce my players to a more milsim/survival mode of gameplay. Meanwhile for 2300 AD  I'm fundamentally more interested in it over the default 3I Traveller setting  and it's been delayed twice at this point (first from Brexit and staff shortages  second from COVID)  so I'm hoping Mongoose will actually be able to release it next year like they currently have planned.  Edit: Completely forgot that Cyberpunk Red is finally off to the printer. Can't wait for the full rules (and the full version of the new netrunning system).
2277,Maybe try *Release the Spyce * it's set in modern day rather than Steampunk. But has a similar spy girls teaming up to fight evil.  Also possibly *Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero * though that again is modern set  there's not many Steampunk anime.
2278, Ultimately I felt the tunnels and trolls adventures in Japan felt odd to me. The presentation of the manga art lead me to believe the stories in this book were more suited to an audience that consumes anime and that ins not really the case.
2279,Vajra Enterprises has lots of games with horror elements  In Dark Alleys and Hoodoo Blues are great for supernatural horror  Fates Worse Than Death is cyberpunk horror  and Kidworld is post-apocalypse horror  basically Lord of the Flies only the adults never return.
2280,Stats because I simply don’t have the intuition nor patience for learning CS concepts  Out of all of my intro courses in my 1st year  by far C++ was the hardest. I was an engineer in undergrad and at the time they required everyone to take intro C++. Now they eliminated that requirement and you can take Matlab which is far easier (and imo more useful if you are focusing on non CS math/stat things).   Idk what it is but CS algorithms are absolute hell for me. I can do complicated statistics but   figuring out problems like finding repeats in sequences  efficient sorting  etc are a nightmare and I don’t know how the fuck people can come up with that.  Same with production. Even though i was a BME  I enjoyed model building in my senior design but when it came to device implementation I had no idea. Im just not that good at those end user sort of things. Luckily we didn’t have to get that far in that project though would have been “nice to have”.
2281,Yeah  my local mechanic who has worked on 7 of our cars through the years has finally gone out of business. It’s literally saved us thousands of dollars and it was refreshing to have an honest conversation. Luckily he’s going mobile  but I doubt he’ll do the big jobs he used to do.
2282,You will see over 50% cars are EVs in SF BayArea  and most are Tesla.   For sport car  you can see many Mustang  many Dodge twice  and many Corvette and Camaro brothers in there too. Of course  you can see many Porsches as well. There are many classic models too.
2283,[https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/118784/Golden-Sky-Stories](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/118784/Golden-Sky-Stories)     ***Golden Skies Stories!***     An adorable zero-combat RPG that has you playing in a cute little village as sweet animal people and solving puzzles  working together to uncover mysteries and more!     I've played this a few times both with hardcore RPG types and casual first timers and they all love it. I think the fact you don't have to focus on combat at all allows a lot of players freedom to make an easily-made but surprisingly deep character sheet  no need to worry about feats and stats and stuff!
2284,"The best way  imho  is to self-edit.  Critique yourself a day or two after the session  ask honest questions like:  What did you enjoy the most about the game? How did the players interact with the world and each other? Was there any part where I got confused or ""lost the flow?""  Different games is good  but I would say the way to become an advanced game master is to look BEYOND games. Could you make an encounter that would be interesting without relying on any rules or dice rolling?  Running for different players is important  especially if you can find different *types* of players to run for. You learn a lot about your strengths and weaknesses as a GM when you run into a playstyle that's different than your home groups.  Tutorials are cool  but useless without the right context.  I've met multiple people who have read article after article about how to make awesome NPCs... when they haven't even ran a session  they don't even know if they have a problem with NPCs or not!  Lastly... it's important to realize that it doesn't matter. What matters is that you get what you want out of your games  and you don't need to run five-nights-a-week in fourteen different systems to do that :)"
2285,There is no defense for crunch. Devs  just like everyone else  need to work regular hours or they get burnt out. Its fucking awful this industry pushes people to this length of 100+ hour work weeks and worse conditions
2286,I believe the difference is the next:    \- ML is a job for an engineer who do the algorithm for a back-end software in order to create a more efficient application than a simple programmer could do.   \- Data Scientist can be a physical  mathematician or engineer who tends to use statistical knowledge applied to databases in the order to predict impacts on the company or industry.

2287,It just depends on where you’re at man. I live in Hot Springs AR. I’ve been told by a chief police officer while installing his internet that they don’t pull people over around here until they’re doing 11+ mph over the speed limit.   And it’s gotta be more like 15 before a ticket issued depending on how the individual was driving or whatever.   But meanwhile in my hometown in Louisiana  that area/whole states cops are known for being massive douches.   I was ticketed for doing 7 over the speed limit on a empty highway. Not driving recklessly or anything.   Down there I do not go anything over 5 unless I’m on a back road where I know for certain no cop is at.
2288,Oh nice.   Alternative maybe you can also scale/unscale it with recording in animator instead of drawing because you will not always have such a simple sprite to edit but i dont know if it will have the same result.
2289,"You cannot ""compete in the marketplace"" with stolen property.  You can  however  steal all the ideas you want and make your own homebrew game to play with friends and family.

2290,Don't let the haters get you  R can be in production code–there is an entire website dedicated to this idea https://putrinprod.com/. What you need to put R in production is what you need with every other language: well written code  with good documentation  that is reproducible and tested. The best mechanism R has for this is packages. Make your code into a good package  and it will meet all the requirements.
2291,I am still a student(Masters)  but have done 2 student jobs/internships as of now.  Majority of the time I was creating python scripts for sending and receiving data from REST APIs  and this was for applications  for which they had access to the APIs.   Other than this  I was writing 50-150 line python scripts for data analytics stuff  with a little bit of linear modelling in between.  I have not yet started working on concrete ML or Data science analysis stuff yet  but will start soon enough.  Also  before I started with my masters  I worked with SQL and shell scripting(sed awk etc.) for 4 years. So that helped me easily ramp up with sql stuff for the tasks I have.  My takeaway is that..... Not everytime you get to do some crazy time series analysis and construct models for prediction etc. You may hav drudge through some monotonous activities  in order to start working on the more interesting and brain intensive part of the tasks. Idk if this will be your first job  but if it is.. then get ready to do some normal/lower level tasks in the beginning until you get trusted to work on some bigger things and handle projects on your own. Of course this is not the case everywhere  but many companies still prefer doing things this way.
2292,As most things it depends on your interest.   As was suggested if you’re still exploring  find different job descriptions and dig into those positions see what particular tasks and responsibilities draw out your attention.   From the sounds of it  it seems you have a programmatic mind and enjoy applying logical arguments to solve problems if that’s the case continue to build on those skills and expand your repertoire in computer learning.   On the other hand if what you enjoy about data science is the quantitative analysis portions and building algorithmic models to solve problems than refocus your energy on building a stronger mathematics acumen.   Either road you choose as your primary focus will require some understanding of your secondary. So don’t imagine that by focusing on computer learning you won’t further your understanding of mathematical concepts it’s simply not the case. Just think about where you want to apply the most effort and once you decide go full steam ahead. In any team you join there will be data scientists stronger in one area over the other  the trick is to find your strength area and compare yourself with others who also have that same strength area. Ultimately the conversation you’ll have for a job is around what you can bring to the team. If you’re just all around mediocre it’ll be difficult to clearly define where team can lean on you  and how your skills and interest fit into a team.   That’s my two cents I’m in a similar boat. Going the route of building my quantitative analysis capability. After 6 years of working with data I realize what gets me excited is working through algorithms so that’s where I’m directing my energy.
2293,I thought social media was getting obsolete 4 years ago. Friends of mine are charging 75 euro per hour to companies who want to outsource that part. Data science is part of our new lives and techniques are developing. It’s not possible for it to become obsolete for it is developing with time.
2294,Ya don't say! My mom and I saw a truck with blue led's around the inside of its wheels... [Like this.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1766/0599/products/Jeep-Starwood-WHEELRINGS_1024x1024.jpg?v=1596550829)
2295,I am pretty much getting a rav4.  It's kind of a blue Grey color. Exterior is in great shape.  Maintained well.  60k miles maybe.  It's like new.   Has steel rims. Tires are new. Advice on new rims (black would be nice) and keeping old tires?  I want a nicer stereo. I can tackle the selection of pieces. But.....  .... I want to pay someone to install a stereo and do sound deadening.  What's up with sound deadening these days?  Wheel wells matter most.  In this year model can I do tear down on my own?  I can install shit easy enough.  Take door panels off  etc?
2296,"Not to add too much more to what others have said  but what year is this Santa Fe? It's my understanding that some of the first CUVs (like my old Tribute) had a ""lock"" button that allowed you to keep AWD from kicking in and out  but newer CUVs don't usually have this capability anymore. If/when they have have AWD  it's fully automatic in its function  with no capacity for driver input."
2297,I don't know anybody who isn't deep into car culture or a journalist or \*specifically\* interested in that particular car who cares or watches these launches. Most average people will just look up a car review from a google search to find out basic facts before their purchase... or maybe I'm fooling myself even with that. Most probably just wander onto a lot and pick the car that fits their budget and looks nice.  )
2298,When you say SQL  does that mean you have access to an enterprise SQL server instance  or are you trying to set up one on your machine? If the former  then a lot of the joins and aggregations are faster on the SQL server. If you are setting up one in your PC then you will have the same memory issues
2299,Well... what have you seen so far? It'd be nice to know  so we aren't recommending you stuff  that you've seen already. Please edit your post  so others can see it  and list some of what you've seen  it'd help us out.

2300,We're back with another weekend of late night anime  and this time  it's Mahouka!  Our main cast is already cracking their brains on theorizing the parasites' origins  and it seems like Mikihiko may be onto something. It's going to be interesting to observe how events will unfold in the anime as an LN reader.  The brief fight scene among the members and deserters of STARS give us a glimpse of what may be in the coming episodes. Tatsuya's going to want to be careful of his new adversaries  considering that they  are impervious to his specialization of magic which he is renowned for in First High.  Erika looks like she's ready to dish out some serious punishment during her confrontation with her big bro. Though part of her irritation may be due to him spying in on his little sister's special alone time with her favorite pupil. I wonder if we'll get more such moments like this in the future? It'll certainly be a welcome addition.  There's also that little bit with best girl Lina towards the end after her debriefing with the two members of her team who fought against the parasites. She appears to have really taken a liking to her new uniform  considering the fact that she brought it all the way to her base of operations. Poor Silvie though  she must be a handful when they're off duty.  Looks like things are also shaping up for the Ten Master Clans to be involved with this Vampire business. Maya's going to want some damage control for sure. I'm looking forward to next week already!
2301,Is there a run down of any improvements with QD-OLED? Sounds to me like the black levels would get very dark if not completely off while not having as much burn in potential because all the OLEDs are blue and would wear more evenly
2302,Eventually the technical challenges became boring and the people challenges became interesting. I went from thinking my solution is the most elegant solution ever to I wonder if “BoB/Susan” can solve it better.
2303,Over the Edge! I think that matches every single one of these  with the exception that I can't remember how it handles armor/defense.  No levels  Classes (sorta) with the way it handles a broad occupation  super light system and easily modified  life is handled by wounds by description (which also influences the character)  and it uses target numbers.  Really interesting setting as well  but not really important for what you're looking for.
2304,SAS is investing a lot in creating SAS tools that enables low code/no code for analytics and ML. The platform is called SAS Viya.   Your pain is real though - but should become lessened in the future as enterprises move to Viya.
2305,> via removing the bleeder valve   wait what? you mean the nipple? you're not supposed to remove it. you're supposed to undo it slightly  then someone pumps the brakes and _holds them down_ while you tighten it back up  then they release. and repeat until no more air.
2306,You can’t have multiple prices for the same item  but you can make multiple IAP items in the backend and have them give the same reward. Lots of games will offer “bundles” of items or something similar and target them towards specific user segments (paying users non-paying users).
2307,I am a data scientist who has roughly two years experience (1 year post grad school).  &#x200B   1. I work with network traffic data  but have also worked with x509 certificate. The network traffic data is a mix of text and numeric fields (it is tabular.) The x509 certificate data is a base64 encoded string that I convert to tabular data using an x509 library. Prior to that I worked with customer engagement data and opportunity data for account based marketing. 2. In a prior life I used some R and SQL  but as of now I use Python and Scala. I use PANDAS  scikit-learn  seaborn  numpy  etc. in Python and Apache Spark in scala. 3. For clustering it varies (we generally test Agglomerative Clustering  KMeans  DBSCAN  etc.) for classification we use RandomForest or Gradient Boosted Trees. 4. We have some in-house data preprocessing steps we follow  nothing that would really generalize. While this doesn't generalize to the rest of my team  I try and do as much of the standard aggregations and preprocessing in scala and then I do feature engineering in Python. There isn't a science behind this  it's more for convenience (some of my team doesn't really use scala.) 5. We're R&D so mostly jupyter notebooks or slide decks  depending on the week. We also write documentation for implementing models in our product. 6. I generally have one to two meetings a day. We work in three week sprints and deadlines depend on the project. For the most part  they align with our sprints. 7. Cybersecurity
2308,I'm preparing to start a youtube devlog channel simlar to Sam Hogans and wanted to know what do people want to watch? I was think of making a video like flappy birds but rtx is On for another game. I was wondering what game would you like to see graphically upgraded?
2309,There won’t be enough PS5s to go around. If you think that 5% of the market can’t afford a $500 console  then your terribly misinformed of both the average gamer (mid 30s) and the state of the economy.  Yes things are bad for a lot of people  but the majority of are getting by fine.  This is not to downplay how bad things are for many.  A lot of people are having a hard time  far more than there should be... but most are doing just fine financially.
2310,I don't think one is easier or better than the other  but R is just highly unconventional. If you have no programming experience  then R will not teach you good development practices that you can reuse in other languages. On the other hand  if you are an experienced programmer  then you will find something like `my.variable$a %<>% tolower` confusing.  Having said this  R definitely has some strengths when compared with Python. I think most of those who are familiar with both Python and R would agree that dplyr offers a more pleasant API than pandas. Additionally  I personally find that R has better reporting tools such as Rmarkdown and Shiny which are better (in my opinion) than Python's Dash and Mistune (note: Jupyter can be used by both R and Python).  However  usually  when you are developing a model  you need to integrate it into your tech stack  deploy it  monitor it  etc and that's where R isn't a conventional choice for reasons described in the first paragraph.
2311,Maybe I never saw the exact source quote  but didn’t they say “we don’t do crunch” and then turn around later and say “we’re doing crunch”?  Some parts of the internet will get a hate boner about crunch no matter what  but but the problem I see was that they said they don’t do crunch  and then did crunch.   Have they come out and acknowledged that they said they don’t do crunch  and explained why this was an exception? I feel like even that would help.   “Hey guys  I know we said we don’t do this  and we really tried everything to avoid it  but there’s just no way for us to deliver this product without it  so we’re here admitting we were wrong and hoping you can forgive us”   is very different from   “Hey guys  we’re doing crunch. Everyone else is doing it  why are you so mad that we are doing it? Here’s all these other reasons we’re still good  that totally exonerates us  right?”  Edit: holy fuck  y’all. Please keep giving me this great popcorn reading. People are fucking /passionate/ about this.
2312,I hate how whenever you google how to do something in SAS you have to sift through those damn tutorials which are sort of written like imitation  academic white papers.  Just tell me how to transpose this dataset goddammit.
2313,I have found that i enjoy watching people play games that have physics-based mechanics (worms  stick fight  fall guys  etc)  which is an extremely easy thing to base a game around.  That and characters  im not about to watch a pro series of digital jenga.
2314,Hey  a car I have experience with!  I drove many hundreds of miles on a 2019 Jetta manual base model and the rev hang was ATTROCIOUS. The absolute worst rev hang I’ve ever experienced on any car  period. The tuning side of the hang was bad  the dual mass flywheel made it worse  and  to top it off  a clutch delay valve on top of that. Wouldn’t consider the car with a manual for a second. Anyways.  The key is to either to shift into second very early on (the car has enough torque to do it below 10 MPH) or to rev it out above 4000 RPM and just wait a second or two to push the clutch to the floor and select second. You might need to daintily go into second  too  as from my experience  it will fight you if you change gear too quickly for its liking  even if the clutch pedal is all the way to the floor.
2315,The BRZ powerband is not linear  with that notorious torque dip. While the Miata is linear. The weight difference at that point also makes a difference.   In addition  wanting more power out of a Miata sort of misses the point of that car. It’s not supposed to be a drag racing monster. It’s a lightweight  tossable bomb down the Tail of the dragon type of car.
2316,I'm making some modifications to my company's DA job description  and I'm curious what would convince people to apply who might not otherwise. We're a 250-person data-driven marketing firm with about 30 people on the DS team.  What's a reason you \_wouldn't\_ apply to a DA job? How could I convince you to do so?  &#x200B   Some ideas:  &#x200B   \* Types of projects  \* Types of tools used  \* Workload flexibility  \* Remote work  \* Company size or team size  \* Awards we've won  \* Who you'll be working with (PhD data scientists  creative producers  e.g.)  \* Opportunities for advancement  \* Client-facing opportunities  \* Perks (like parental leave  full time barista  vacation bonus etc)  &#x200B   &#x200B   Anything I'm missing?
2317,I have no answer to your question  but a question for you is how many data science jobs have you had? If it's just been 1 or 2 companies maybe you just haven't found the right fit and need to look for something just a little different. Maybe a different industry but still doing data science.
2318,I think these are insanely cool cars but aim for a very specific market.   It’s a fun to drive torquey cruiser that get ridiculous MPG or km/L  rather  that you can drive just to drive anywhere in the EU without stuffing cash into your gas tank. Runs and drives clean  can and should be driven frequently  cheap to run (until the repair bill)  looks absolutely incredible.   It’s for the European dentist who likes to just drive for the sake of driving. It was never meant to crush track times.
2319,I have the $15 one from O'Reilly's that sticks to the dashboard. The adhesive is good  and it can hold the phone either sideways or upright. They tend to last about two years  using them every day. My car has a flat and wide dash  so it just sits on top.
2320,Looking to build with these new processors around February of next year when Ampere stock has (hopefully) become a bit better. I'm worried  however  about the rumors of DDR5 ram becoming consumer viable by the end of 2021. Should I just wait for AM5 motherboards?
2321,Hi all   Can anyone help me regarding Data Visualization . I learned the basics of matplotlib but It's very big library with 100s of commands . I'm stuck at how I can use them in what sense . I've tried some basic plots in my projects   but when I read the documentation it's very frustrated   What things should I learn to master enough matplotlib for any type of plot ?
2322,I‘ve actually got two.    First up  there was „King of Thorns“  an Anime movie I watched when I was... 13? I liked it but forgot about it quickly.  And then at 16 years I watched the beginning of the first episode of „Mirai Nikki“ (Engl.: „Future Diary“) and then it all began...
2323,Nvidia doesn’t want to sell too many FE cards. The cooler alone is very expensive and they are selling it at   lower than AIBs. Their main goal is to sell a bunch of cards that will distort the price/perf argument for the rest of the generation. They know full well prices won’t actually be that low for the cards in this generation. Scummy business practice and marketing.  Edit: Also AIBs aren't too happy about the FE being so much flashier/better at lower price. Basically undercutting their cards and making their cooler solutions look ancient. Wouldn't be surprised if AIB's are artificially scalping (hint MSI) out of spite against Nvidia.
2324,Thirding 4th edition D&D.  If you don't want to invest as much  the spinoff game Strike! is a very streamlined game that is in a similar vein... but I mean *very* streamlined  it doesn't even really have stats and equipment in the sense it is used in most games (instead all those things are rolled into your characters' abilities).
2325,This is the $1M question. In my opinion they are all kinda crap  but which one is least crap just depends on your car's layout.  * Cupholder - Takes up a cup holder  but brings the phone within much easier reach. Potentially makes you look down and away from the road a little too much.   * AC Vent - Blocks the vent. Kinda an upside in the summer because your phone gets blasted with AC in the summer when you're charging/running maps so it doesn't overheat - con in the winter though. May or may not work for you depending on your vent design  also may vary how much you have to look away from the road. Heavier phones tend to dislodge the mount.     * CD Slot -- Blocks some buttons. Some cars have their CD slots in the glove box or all the way down in the stack these days  making this useless.    * Suction cup -- Perfect line of sight as you're already looking at the windshield. Depending on how raked your windshield is  might be a long reach to touch the phone though. You can counteract that with a holder with a long neck (I have [this one] (https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Windshield-Anti-Shake-Stabilizer-Compatible/dp/B07X2WGT72/)) but that just gives it much more leverage for your phone to move around on you  especially with a heavier phone. (We have a Pixel 3XL and iPhone SE. The iPhone stays reasonably put  the Pixel flops around quite a bit).   Definitely looking forward to the next car having Android/Apple support. Until then....the suffering continues.
2326,This would typically mean sleepers  like the 2000-05 generation Taurus with the 2JZ RWD swap  or 1st gen Chrysler Sebring with AWD 4G63 (they are stretched 2G Eclipses so...) but do you think there seems to be at least one crazily modded car of each kind?  Like someone has a quick/fun 2ZZ swap 98-02 Corolla? Ect  ect? Doesn't even need to be a crazy swap. Someone have  or know of a well modified car that normally doesn't get love in that way?  Know of any?
2327,GN measured 18.5% more power under a gaming load than a 2080 Ti  and I'm seeing up to 32% faster on average at 4K. So this is an 11% improvement in performance/watt. That's kinda really bad for a new architecture on a new node. And no OC headroom  either.
2328,"I have to use SAS at my job  though my job isn't specifically data science related. I would much prefer to use R or Python  but probably the biggest ""feature"" that I've found hard to replicate in R (not sure about python) is the comprehensive logging that SAS does.  Even silly things like doing a merge (though don't get me started on SAS merges)  have useful log outputs like if you're expecting a 1:1 relationship you'll get commentary which indicates this isn't the case. Now I'm sure this is possible to do in R and Python  but my guess is you have to code up all of these ""unit tests?"" your self. When SAS just dumps so much stuff out automatically. You can run it batch mode to get a separate txt file of all the logs.  That said visualisation  modelling  documentation  macro syntax  having to pay extra to do time series and tree analysis all just sucks."
2329,Are you telling me they just figured this out? Have they just been looking at Xbox and giggling about console sales while Xbox has been launching games on pc and making it possible to play Xbox games on any android mobile device? What’s the point of console wars if you just increased your player base with PC players and mobile game pass players?
2330,honestly McLaren is just boring these days. They put out so many versions that people just don't care any more.   the McLaren 765LT basically came and went and noone gave a shit about it...and its only been like 2 months.  Hell  even their latest halo cars noone cares any more. Like the McLaren Speedtail  it got like a few articles and thats it  the interest is just gone.   What McLaren needs to do is rethink their branding. Do what 911 did  have main lineup name and then just stuff the weird stuff into it  so the main name grows withe very iteration  and enters the consumer mindset and gets loyal fans for future versions.   For example  lets use the McLaren Senna name for the main line up...awesome name  perfect for a sports car. And take McLaren race driver names for other models.  * McLaren Senna Base = 720S * McLaren Senna LT = 765LT  * McLaren Senna RS = Current Senna * McLaren Senna Speedtail = Current Speedtail * McLaren Senna Elva = Current Elva  * McLaren Hamilton = 570S  * McLaren Hamilton LT = 600LT * McLaren Hamitlon GT = 570GT  * McLaren Prost =McLaren GT

2332,Another issue with franchises is most of them have mechanics who are near the beginning of their career and aren't vested in the shop. Most of the independent shops are more seasoned who have had the time to save up for their own shop. They care about the work they do because that's how they make their living and they have more experience to back it up.
2333,what exactly do you mean by more cinematic? what exactly does city of mist doesn't do that you are looking for or does that you don't want? it's a pretty great system I would just say run it if it's 90% of the way what you're looking for.
2334,There is also [Null and Peta](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40178/Null_Peta)  which is an anime short. Not exactly the best series out there  but it does have a tech girl making robots and programming alongside some other hijinks.
2335,I took a stab at making a particle effect for a popping balloon  but I know it could use a lot of improvements.  Does anyone have any suggestions for ways to make this look more realistic?  Remixes of the Scratch project welcome if you happen to have a Scratch account.

2336,Yeah  I have big hands and Palm Grip - I gave the DA Elite a try and it felt great.    But  Synapse guaranteed that I would never buy one.  I'm sure there are plenty of other people with the same sentiments.  GG Razer.
2337,"Please watch 1 or 2 videos before this one from him... He was moaning about how his information is more premium than others' and that Big Navi would only compete with the 3070 and that other leakers are wrong and he's right...  And now in this video he's moaning the opposite about how AMD are all going all out like he said it all along.. This guy is a meme man... I blocked his channel.. Just like ""Not an apple fan"".. This bloke keeps copying others' info and saying some secret sources told him (AFTER others already reported on it) time and time again. And during his live streams he get's called out on it and wasted on Whiskey he starts scolding his viewers...  FYI  I'm not saying the info above is wrong.. Just saying these guys are memes and I'd rather not support opportunistic soft spined creatures like them..."
2338,"When Word ""comes with"" a computer  it's usually nothing more than a *trial version*.  This means it is only licensed to be used for a *certain amount of time*.  Only certain IdeaPad and IdeaCentre laptops in Malaysia get bundled with pre-installed full versions of Microsoft Office.  Your dad did not do anything  **it was simply a coincidence**. Your trial *expired* the same day your dad borrowed your laptop."
2339,If all they do is increase VRAM then it’s not much more than a “looks better on the box” move for gaming. If everything else stays the same then these cards will perform identically in 99% in games for the foreseeable future.   I’m not doubting them releasing a simple VRAM bump just to have “BIGGER NUMBER” than AMD but it would be so much more appealing and logical to me for them to do a 3080ti instead with some extra cores as well sometime next year when yields allow and they don’t mind stepping on 3090’s toes.
2340,"A pretty.. decent episode  unremarkable in some ways. It feels more like it's there to establish a ""Normal"" that is there to be broken. Since at most what we learn is that one of the girls was a late sleeper until she wasn't  some flashback with a burning Sword and Kid Odin being... well Kid Odin. Otherwise just your bog-standard repetition of stuff we know  bonding between the girls  beating a monster of the week and that's it really.  We even had a moment where we learn that Claudias Father had been to Japan and of course had a sword from there and of course admired their culture.. I mean  it just all felt so.. Rote.  I can only assume that this is all an intentional setup for some more crazy stuff to happen."
2341,TBF  crossover isn’t really designed for performance and handling  it’s just a typical daily drive vehicle. That is why these luxury automakers choice FWD platforms for their unibody luxury crossovers. Any sporty and handling things  they rather to give their sedan and coupe models.
2342,Simple solution. Bring the Super Charged 5.0L back into the XF  XFR and XFR-S. The engine in them now is pathetic and sounds like crap IMO. Or make that V6 more powerful because it is a dog in a heavy car. OMG I just read that the SC v6 is going away also..bad move. https://www.autoblog.com/2020/10/05/2021-jaguar-xf-revealed/
2343,Hey guys been about two to three hours into the campaign and opened up avengers initiative to unlock the hero challenge cards and I’ve done a couple weekly challenges for hulk and ms marvel and a couple daily challenges for ms marvel but none of my points towards their specific hero cards are showing did I do something wrong or do I need to play further into the campaign to un lock them? I’m just confused cause I’m doing challenges and there not registering any help from anyone please!
2344,If you're curious to what Anime I'm in to  there's no answer to that but I'll put out the Animes I've watched for the past month  Sword Art Online  Tsurezure Children  Teasing Master Takagi-San  Toradora  Gamers!  Nisekoi  Darling in the Franxx  and Bunny Girl Senpai (I don't remember the full name) I'd highly recommend every single one of these if you're also looking for a recommendation.
2345,I mean  I have a gaming PC  I don't need an Xbox.  Which Microsoft is perfectly fine with.  I'm still gonna buy their games and probably sub to game pass here or there.  They're getting my money even if I don't buy their console.
2346,I am a student  and i am learning game development rn  i never published a game so i was planning to publish  one  i don't need a very high game engine without very high lightnings and graphics  the game i am planning to make is some kind of weird walking simulator at late night or in asylum  so that's why i need to give it a shitty graphics look   just a simple game engine  excluding Unity  UE4  Godot. Thank You
2347,"Hi  I am questioning whether the macbook pro base model would be better than my purchase of the macbook air 2020. Im a HS senior planning on heading to college soon  so I would use my laptop for school work  documents  video conferences  etc. but I also want to use it for gaming (minecraft  league of legends  paladins  sims 4) and watching yt on the side. Do you think my current specs can handle these things or should I return my air (got it from costco) and purchase a base macbook pro. I listed the information below for the two. Just from running a video with some tabs open the fans would go off and the CPU would reach around 90C. I would appreciate any insight! Thanks in advance  My current MacBook Air:  Retina  13-inch  2020  Processor: 1.2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7  Memory: Retina  13-inch  2020  Start up Disk: Macintosh HD  Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 1536 MB  Prospective macbook pro:  Apple MacBook Pro 13.3"" with Touch Bar - 8th Gen Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Space Gray  (both of these are from costco)"
2348,I think I had the same issue that you are talking about.  I installed the JupyterLab extension and jupyter-kite  but also couldn't get the autocomplete box to pop-up while typing.  My problem was that i didn't have JupyterLab 2.2 installed (which the default install in Anaconda is version 2.1).  Use the conda-forge channel to install JupyterLab 2.2:      conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
2349,This might be a controversial comment but what's to stop Nvidia from charging let's say $1200+ for their mid-tier cards next gen cycle (in order to combat scalpers)?  Would this be their plan all along or just conspiracy?  I think it would be bad PR to just come out with that kind of pricing.
2350,I’d pass on that one. One-day interview is as stupid as it sounds.   What happens if you are working but looking for a new job and you apply to dozens of job postings (like we all do) and then get interviews for 10 of them (not too wild for mid-level in DS). Are you taking 10 days off your annual leave to play the lottery of interviewing?   Interviewing in DS is getting ridiculous  if you are  forcing me to take a day off pay me that day off.
2351,A few days ago you were complaining over on the White Wolf sub about catching flack for creating characters that break their splat archetypes  and now you're over here asking this. I'm confused  do you want a by-the-book game or not?   To answer the question  most of the time I see these games played with significant horror elements. That's definitely how I run them: I'm going to try to make my players angst over their options and actions (because we've all signed on to play a horror game and expect to actually feel something)  and I show the World of Darkness in all its morally gray splendor. However  that's not the only feel I want in the games I run/play  and there's action  dark comedy  intrigue  romance  etc. Games can be primarily in a genre without being limited to it. For the record  this is all tabletop  I've never LARPed  but the visual presentation seems like it would make immersion in horror quite difficult.
2352,Oh hey I'm watching seasonals again for some reason. Hopefully I don't stop watching them again and will be able to continue making updates here.   Also no comments because I'm lazy  maybe I'll get back into the swing of doing them.    | #  | Anime                                                            | Epi | Scr |  |----|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----| | 1  | Mewkledreamy                                                     | 23  | 9   |  | 2  | Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi                         | 1   | 7   |  | 3  | Majo no Tabitabi                                                 | 2   | 7   |  | 4  | Healin' Good Precure                                             | 27  | 7   |  | 5  | Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear                                              | 1   | 7   |  | 6  | Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle - Rhyme Anima                  | 1   | 6   |  | 7  | Taisou Zamurai                                                   | 1   | 6   |  | 8  | Adachi to Shimamura                                              | 1   | 6   |  | 9  | Inu to Neko Docchi mo Katteru to Mainichi Tanoshii               | 2   | 6   |  | 10 | Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko                                   | 1   | 5   |  | 11 | Rail Romanesque                                                  | 2   | 5   |  | 12 | Love Live                                                        | 1   | 5   |  | 13 | Animation Kapibara-san                                           | 1   | 5   |  | 14 | One Room Third Season                                            | 1   | 5   |  | 15 | Guraburu!                                                        | 1   | 5   |  | 16 | Kamisama ni Natta Hi                                             | 1   | 5   |  | 17 | Assault Lily: Bouquet                                            | 2   | 4   |  | 18 | Maoujou de Oyasumi                                               | 1   | 4   |  | 19 | Tonikaku Kawaii                                                  | 2   | 4   |  | 20 | Iwa Kakeru!: Sport Climbing Girls                                | 1   | 4   |  | 21 | Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou  Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen | 1   | 2   |   Mostly a decent start  most shows don't really stand out  I got some good hype for Hanyou  Tabitabi  and Kuma Bear. As a big Inuyasha fan Hanyou is probably the best new seasonal but Kuma Bear's silly outfit and likeable MC and Tabitabi's general solid writing make 3 good new shows to start. The rest are more lukewarm but there is a lot of potential in these shows except for Kimi to Boku. It'll be interesting to see how they turn out.   I hope to see you all next week!
2353,I'm looking to start a little project with a text-based game since it's the simplest thing I can think of to do right now. I want to make it accessible on mobile but I'm not really how to go about it.  I've seen several template based programs like Ren'Py  but I don't like the idea of being confined to their mechanics. I thought maybe Unity would be a good fit  but it's a bit overkill and I'd have to learn c#.  I'm still learning Java and C++  so ideally I'd like to work with one of those.  Any guidance would be really appreciated as I'm just really overwhelmed here. Thank you for reading.
2354,SAO was originally written 2 decades ago when the author was still a novice writer. He wrote it as a self contained short story for a contest that had a word limit. It mainly focused on Kirito and Asuna’s relationship and the major moments of the aincrad arc rather than focusing on the 100 floors. Being that he went over the word limit  he decided to just self publish it as a web novel. He later added some more stories to his aincrad arc (I.e silica and liz’s introductions) and ultimately wrote the ALO to Alicization arcs.   He later got the opportunity to publish SAO as a light novel series. When the anime was announced  they simply took all the aincrad stories he wrote and put them in chronological order. What you see in the anime is basically all he wrote in the light novels.  The author is currently writing the Progressive light novel series to fill in the blanks of the original aincrad arc. It goes floor by floor and it’s currently at the beginning of floor 7. Additionally  they announced a progressive anime adaptation 3 weeks ago. If you want to know more about the aincrad arc  then read the progressive novels or wait for the adaptation.   The anime does a decent job at adapting its source material as far as ln adaptations go. It definitely leaves certain things out (I.e. kirito’s inner monologues and a bunch of kirisuna scenes) but the major moments that matter are adapted well.
2355,I only see Dodge Charger and Ford Expedition CHP vehicles patrolling the freeways. Can't remember the last time I've seen a CHP Crown Vic.   The county sheriff and local city police forces still use the Crown Victoria.
2356,Question reveals you have limited experience in programming. It is doable. Its not something those capable would do. Probably thousands of hours. In your case thousands of hours of study up front.  Read up on network game theory. Its incredibly complicated.
2357,"I get where you're coming from  but it seems awfully selfish to want all of car culture to play by your terms and for everyone to make their builds cater to your tastes.    >I feel like Japan gets JDM in a mature way and other countries’ car culture lacks in that sometimes. Modified cars are art  it’s not about being street-cool or status symbol to me.  No shit  of course the country that spawned ""JDM"" cars would be the most JDM. Japanese culture isn't all track/drift builds. There's a healthy lowrider scene and respect for hip-hop culture. You can even get magazines showcasing all the latest trends in American car culture (and import a Hummer H2 if you'd like). Don't forget VIP style  too...you're not going to be hot lapping Tsukuba in a tricked out Alphard.    > For example  it doesn’t make much sense how a JDM guy could own a Fujiwara Tofu AE86 and blast hip-hop instead of Gas Gas Gas or a Hatsune Miku song. I hope the day doesn’t come where Cardi B owns a widebody 800hp BRZ with Asuna from Swort Art Online drawn with a big butt on the sides and Justin Bieber owns a 1200hp 2JZ S15 drift car with a Hatsune Miku Good Smile Racing wrap  because that would be ridiculous.  Thanks for the tip. I'll make sure to listen to only listen to songs you deem ""JDM"" in the car I paid for instead of the ones I want. Am I only allowed to listen to ABBA's greatest hits in my Volvo?  Jokes aside  people aren't 1-D or are tied down by the the image their car presents. I think that ought to be what you take away from this experiment.  Also that day has sort of come: Lil' Uzi Vert has sported a bunch of itasha wraps on his R8 and T-Pain has a S14 drift car as a weekend toy."
2358,"I don't know how laws work there in France  but if you use to work extra hours to meet deadlines and now the fired you because you were having a ""poor performance"" I don't think that qualifies as ""with cause"" You might have a chance to sue them."
2359,I can't remember what anime is this from!  In this anime there's a character that can see a line on people's head  and when this line snaps the person dies  Can you help me what anime is this from?  EDIT: Thanks to  [H-Ryougi](https://www.reddit.com/user/H-Ryougi/) i found it was the antagonist from ERASED!      
2360,In order of increasing complexity  I can recommend: Fudge  Savage Worlds  GURPS. Current favorite is Savage Worlds  but they all have their pros and cons. You can get Fudge for free  and free test drive rules for SW and GURPS.
2361,While it sounds like it probably isn’t heavy enough for what you want  in the past I just printed on paper rather than cardstock (this is 20+ years ago and I didn’t have a printer that could cope with cardstock) and then stuck on various thicknesses of cardboard. I’d get cardboard from an art/craft store. These days I’d consider re-using cardboard from packaging (some breakfast cereal packaging I’ve found can be quite robust  and I know of an artist who just draws on the ‘blank’ sides of such things too: so  it can be tough enough for some purposes).  A lot of PVA/craft glues say they’ll stick paper and wood - so maybe find a light/thin wood sheet you can cut up and stick the paper/cardstock images to. Model shops often have thicker plastic sheets too - so perhaps that could be adapted - perhaps check out whatever it is that gets used for making bases for figures in wargames etc.  Thats about all I can think of...
2362,I’ve been wanting to get a switch for the longest time but I want to wait for a second version that has better controllers. I recently added and fixed up my second living room into a theater room with a big empty spot in the middle so that I can have enough space to fling Willy nilly like I did with my original wii.
2363,Job market for experienced data scientists in UK was quiet from late March to June but then returned to normal or even hotter than before in July. If you have some experience there are jobs for the taking. Personally I wouldn't go to a start-up now though buy as others said  look for a solid company.
2364,Hey everyone  i just finished reading lex occultums core book Lex Libris  from Riotminds  and all i can say is WOW. the book is just a vault of knowledge  out of the 245 pages  maybe 50-60 are rules specific to the game  the rest is just history during the 1700's. Of course some is changed to suite the occult/magical nature of the game  but the rest is just such useful information. It is all super well written  tons of facts  people  places  everything someone would need to run a european historical game.  Not to mention the art itself is beautiful!  &#x200B   The rules of the game seem PRETTY complex  though i havent read their other corebook which is specifically about character creation but it looks pretty dense.      Anyway check it out!
2365,It’s the RTX 3080 launch all over again. Hopefully Sony can stop the bots.
2366,Any chance you could use Julia? That’s another good option  depending upon what type of modeling you’re doing. But otherwise  yea  R would be much more relevant to a career in Data Science than Matlab. It’s particularly good at advanced stats and customized plot making  the more research-y side of DS possibly excluding ML  IMHO.
2367,Atm the current timeseries project I'm working on could use a package like this  so I'd definitely use it if it's around in a few months  otherwise I'll have to hodge podge a quick and dirty version myself.  I  for one  would be grateful.  If you have the time and effort to do it  go do it!  But if you do not  it's totally understandable.
2368,So me and my brother have been trying to thing how to run a Aztec Soulsborne campaign  and although we have an idea for the story  we have problems deciding the system. Specially because of a few things.  1.- It has to have a experience points system  because in Soulsborne games  experience points are both what you use to level up and as currency  and you can loose all the xp gained.  2.- It has to be lethal  but not unfair combat  3.- We want to introduce a sacrifice system  something like  your own health  or that of enemies  or maybe important items. The idea is that maybe this sacrifice powers up some attacks or powers  or give maybe a bonus (any idea exploring this?)  4.- We want it to have a more mystical focus. Dark Souls combat and game was about knowing how to defend  to be patient. Bloodborne was a more fast and violent combat style and gameplay. Sekiro was more based around stealth and parrying the other enemies attacks. So for this game  although we dont want to focus on magic  we do want a more mystical feeling to the combat.  So far  we havent had much luck. Any ideas?
2369,"Your answer is in the name. It's all completely automatic. It will hold the clutch ""in"" in a sense  its basically in neutral when stopped  you probably notice a slight lag when you release the brakes till the car starts to roll  just like a manual it's slowly applying the clutch.   And when in manual or sport mode when you are requesting gear changes  it won't shift to a gear that would damage itself. Like if your at 6k rpm and request a downshift  it won't untill it is safe to do so  same with upshifting  although sometimes you can still bog the engine a bit.  And when coming to a stop  it will automatically downshift if you were in 3rd and have to stop."
2370,Looks pretty decent increase considering that 3080s barely overclock.  So 3080's reviews were to drop on Monday while launch was on Friday  but they're pushed back. 3090 reviews are still on track or do we still don't have a date for it?
2371,>Dungeons and Dragons  Shadowrun  and plenty of other big name games might briefly touch on or mention inclusivity and diversity  but I’ve yet to see a game bigger than Fate come out with something as awesome as an Accessibility Toolkit.  It has felt like Wizards has been acting in reaction to a push for representation and inclusivity  while Evil Hat has actively been the ones pushing themselves to seek out ways to be awesome for more people. I appreciate that.
2372,Hey  others have certainly provided great feedback  so I’m actually here to ask a question:  What Khan Academy classes?  You said “all of them”  but I’m assuming you don’t mean preschool and such.  So which actual classes were you planning to do and in what order?  I don’t have a masters  and I’ve been away from math for too long now and I’m trying to dig back into it all.
2373, I’ve finished these anime or am caught up: Naruto  Dragon Ball  Full Metal Alchemist  My Hero Academia  Hunter x Hunter Death Note  One Piece   I only watched 12 episodes of Bleach since it was boring. I don’t know if should continue it.
2374,Hmmm... There aren't many anime out there I can think of with male yandere. It's a common trope in otome games  but their adaptations tend to be pretty mediocre.   As a MC  though  I really can't think of any.

2376,Oh ny god Im so ready  Soul Silver stands as my favorite Pokemon game of all time. Original Silver was the first Pokemon game I really got into and understood  and going through the entire plot and discovering Lance is the champion and fighting Red at Mt. Silver are some of my fondest early gaming memories.  It's time.
2377,"Hi!  &#x200B   I have a question about how to handle some data  and I was wondering people's opinion. TL/DR at the end.  &#x200B   I have a dataset that contains around 1000 ""cases""  with 75 variables. Some variables are completely filled for all cases  some have missing values for a few cases  and some have missing values for many cases. I have splitted half of them as a train-set and the other as a test-set. I'm training a prediction algorithm based on one of the variables as outcome.  &#x200B   In a first approach  I have selected the best subset of variables that keep the most number of complete cases  losing the less information possible. Let's say 250 cases and 40 variables.  &#x200B   For them  I applied LASSO to get a lesser subset of variables  let's say  6. Afterwards  I find 4 of them significative  and 2 are not (Cox regression). Let's say my goal is to fit a logistic model using the four variables I ended up selecting (to get a numeric probabiity)  but I might have rejected many cases from my train-set due to missing values on variables that I'm no longer using to train the final model. Would it be OK to reconsider all those discarded cases now that I know that variable is not going to be used  to have more cases to train the model? Or once I discarded them for one reason in the former step  I shouldn't be able to reconsider them again based on posterior information?  &#x200B   I'm not using the test-set for any of these purposes.  &#x200B   Thanks!!  &#x200B   TL/DR: I'm discarding data due some criteria in some variables I'm not using afterwards. Can I reconsider those cases in my dataset once I know I'm not using them?"
2378,Yes you can use the GPU for things like this  and many games do. One example is GPU simulated particles. The only cost to doing things like this on the GPU is that you have to upload the data from the CPU and then read it back from the GPU. Sometimes because of the cost it makes more sense to do the calculations in parallel on the CPU  but it depends on the circumstances.
2379,Usually to enter Data science world  some data science job are require you to have data analyst background/experience first  and data analyst job are more like entry level compared to data science. Just try both and take either chance  you can use data analyst as stepping stone to data scientist position.
2380,In my experience  very few people will comment on a car unless they’re at least something of an enthusiast. I almost always get left alone when I’m out in my NSX  there’s the occasionally thumbs-up at a gas station but most people don’t know what it is enough to care to approach and ask. Those who do are genuinely enthusiastic to see one and are always pleasant to talk to  so I don’t see that attention as a negative.  On the highway sometimes I’ll get people wanting to do some pulls or rev at me at a stoplight but those are rare and far between.
2381,"   We were introduced briefly to ""Father"" of Claudia which is not Odin. It contradicts with the previous episode and statements of Odin calling her his beloved daughter.   I really don't get it honestly.  As for Odin being actually evil  I doubt it was a surprise for anyone  he seemed sus from the very beggining.   Now as for who might get KIA...I would bet on Miko and I've got my reasons for thinking that way.   She is the genki girl of the bunch  she has the most screen time and lines out of all the cast  everyone adores her and it would be a shame if such a strong ""pillar"" of a team was lost.  An interesting segment during the fight with ""Clione"" Pillar was when Claudia was reminded of an event that is clearly inspired by Sigrdrifa and Sigurd's tale with the surrounded flames and the Sword that broke the armor which Sigrdrifa was sealed in.   Claudy was terrified of this memory but if we really were to go with Norse Myths events then that should occur later in the story  but it didn't."
2382,Just curious b/c Ik F1 cars have 360 degrees of steering rotation b/c there so fast that they need to be able to turn the steering wheel quicker but wouldn’t that be good for everyday cars? I’m just curious. Thanks
2383,While I love both Far Cry and VR games  this game is a real kick in the teeth. They should have just done a real Far Cry game for PC VR and maybe PSVR. Not some VR arcade BS that many of us won't have access to and would have to risk our health to play.
2384,That's quite an exclusion list!  However: [Risus](http://www.risusiverse.com/) I think fits all your criteria.  Why is it really good? It's basically instantaneous  works with a huge variety of settings  is very well supported  and free.
2385,You need more modular prep. Don’t write a story  just prepare some building blocks of a story. Broad events  some NPCs  some enemies. If the players skip the ice wights under the frozen graveyard   they find some lava wights in the flame temple later. Have some tension and possible event triggers but don’t write the whole narrative from A to B.
2386,Everywhere I go  Craigslist  Facebook marketplace  everyone suddenly seems to be asking crazy money. Don't even get me started on Bring a Trailer or eBay  where everyone is overbidding to ridiculous numbers. w\]Whats happening?  why is everything suddenly so expensive?
2387,If you’re relying on tutorials to tell you how to build your game  you are limited to building the kinds of games that people explain in tutorials.  So if you can’t find a tutorial  you have to build a skill set so you don’t need the tutorial. Learn to program and build some smaller / simple games first to develop your skill set.
2388,Bunch of kids will support Epic because of Fortnite.  They’re all rich god damn companies  and no matter what good values they pretend to be fighting for  Epic and Google and Apple only care about money. Let’s not fool ourselves into thinking this is something more than that
2389,Austin is great city but not known for its many biotech firms. Biotech is primarily is three or four places. 1. SFCA  2. Boston 3. Northeast Corridor  NY to NJ to MD areas 4. Seattle. Consider redirecting your energy in these areas if you plan to pursue Biotech.
2390,THE BASEBALL EPISODE IS THE FIRST ONE? THE MADLAD  Okayish first episode  I got a feeling that Yota's mom knows Odin from before.  This episode and probably next week's are the classic calm before the storm
2391,Hey   No lithography expert here  but from my understanding the whole lithography process is well known on paper. What would prevent most companies from competing in this field is not that they cannot set up a manufacturing location  but instead that it would not be competitive.  The question of the yield of a lithography process is central when it comes to investing in such a factory.  An imaginary example to illustrate what I mean: some parts of the manufacturing process have to be done in vacuum to prevent dust from getting in the way (I believe). A better quality vacuum will lead to less defaults  and thus higher yields. But even if you know that  you still need a lot of money and know-how to set up the vacuum chamber.  I hope that my explanation is accurate enough  regardless good luck with your work 🙂
2392,Not much to add on from other great thoughts here (you look like a great candidate  etc.) but I wonder if there are pro bono opportunities at non-profits that could help bolster your arguments that your skills are transferable with real examples where they transferred?
2393,Longest session I ever played was on my (still going strong) Starcraft RPG (original storyline  tho). 18 hours  with stops only to pick up food  bathroom and smoke breaks  and the only reason it stopped is because we (3 players and GM) fell asleep exhausted.
2394,I think we can all agree that the world looks amazing  and the combat has the potential to be just as good. But there's obviously something wrong with the combat. It doesn't have impact  no weight behind attacks. The character looks stiff all around. The sound for combat is also lackluster. If this is a representation of where the current product is  it can use a little more time cooking in the oven. But knowing the track record of Chinese game hopefuls  I would not be surprised if they can't deliver. I'm going to believe in this when it comes out and reviews are in.
2395,Hi! I have a bachelor's degree in Statistics and 3+ years of experience working with advanced analytics and data science.   I recently move to the US  and I feel that people care a lot about Masters here. However  I do not know what kind of Master I should pursue: Ms in Statistics or Ms in Data Science?
2396,Anime or anime seasons?  Cause I definitely did 150+ seasons in last 6 months. COVID made way too much free time. Just cutting the commute to work alone freed like 2 hours a day  not being able to do much social stuff also freed ungodly amounts of time I didn't want to put into gaming or other activities - I already did them as much as I wanted.  So yeah  depending on your situation  it might not be surprising. But it is a lot  definitely on the more extreme side :D Welcome to the club.  P.S. My weekends are basically spent almost 100% binging series - I did SNAFU all 3 seasons in 24 hours.
2397,I'm new to the sub so let me know if this question been ask before.  I noticed in the new Funko Pop Blitz that they based their grid tile on 7x7 which is the same for the game 10 000 000 (which is a classic). But they both are two different kind of match tile game.  Same question as the title. Is there a written rule somewhere or even perhaps just a proven method (it just work kind of thing)?
2398,I wonder if Intel is actually  legitimately internalizing the idea that a strong AMD is beneficial to them in the long-term as a hedge protecting x86_64 against Nvidia/ARM.  In that vein  divesting certain businesses that might help prop up x86_64 in general (even if it means AMD) might be a good business move.
2399,I need to find a way to adjust the angle of each eye (like this: https://www.opticstrainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Torsion.gif)  Does anyone have any idea how I can do this? I would like to do it globally for all Vive applications.
2400,Full Metal Fantasy: Iron Kingdoms RPG.  Setting is a Steampunk-ish/medieval fantasy. Well fleshed-out world to set your campaign in.  Great d6 system. Character creation starts with you choosing two careers (classes)  which makes for a lot of fun combinations.

2402,Because it was the first tabletop RPG  the category originator. It's also an awesome game  each edition. All the RPGs that have followed are building on the model D&D laid out.  Gygax and Arneson inadvertently created *lightning-in-a-bottle*.

2404,This honestly is one of my favorite scenes in anime. It does so much right. It isn't just some funny chase scene  they use it metaphorically as well  the animation and background work is amazing at fits really well  and don't get me started about that amazing ost. Man I love this scene.
2405,Lots of my friends including me stopped playing after a month because of how incomplete it felt compared to other Crossing games.   I’m glad Nintendo is doing well and I love them  I just wish it wasn’t a game a decent portion of the fan base view as a downgrade compared to new leaf that was fuelling it.
2406,"Hey im fairly new to programming  I have spent most of my day looking for answers to which I cannot find a solid answer so I entrust the good bois of this subreddit     I have started making a game(2d  simple graphics)   The game will have many units on the scene at once  I would like to estimate up to 30     I want to give majority of the units an ""agro range""  so far I have found 3ish ways to do it   1-Raycasting in 1-4 directions(lets say 4 for the sake of estimating high)    2-Having some kind of child collider  3ish-getting the distance from a game object tag(this doesnt work as if one tag fails the check they all fail)  &#x200B   So you smart juicy boys  what would the less cpu intensive way of doing agro  is there a better way than these?     I would love to hear thoughts on this :)"
2407,It is better? that's pretty subjective. One of the things you mention is that 2003 is very old to typical anime fandom. Yes  it is also a faithful adaption of the manga which many people recommend checking it out for newcomers rather than 2003.   FMB is on many streaming services than 2003 which makes it is easier to find out.
2408,The best way to find out is to just start playing.  If a DM would tell me my character would have to be part of an adventuring guild I'd quit on the spot. That's not a game I'd ever enjoy. (Based on some bad experiences. Most of that comes from the DM telling me what my character has to do.)
2409,With the size and intricacies of that cooling solution  they could have just put that money towards a more powerful GPU for overall better performance at a lower production price.  This is damage control once they saw XSX specs  but couldn't do anything else to compete because the designs had been finalised long ago.
2410,This is not a powergamer.  This is just an asshole.  The behavior has nothing to do with the game  and you could expect the same if you were playing Mario Kart or checkers or any other damned thing.  You really need to ask whether playing the game is worth the frustration that this person is causing.  You can also talk to the other group members in private and discuss whether he needs to be uninvited from the game.  You can try telling him to stop being a dick (both IC and OOC) but if your other group members aren't going to support you  you might as well just quit and find a better group.  This might help:  [https://i.imgur.com/EwiChyD.png](https://i.imgur.com/EwiChyD.png)
2411,I'm curious what they'll do for their 8 core SKUs. Will there be any that are dual CCX with a 4+4 configuration vs a 8 core single CCX? Kind of like they did with the 3300x and 3100 where it's 2+2 core vs 4 core.
2412,They probably believe their buyers don’t want that kind of suv.  And it’s probably a bit more complicated than just sticking an suv body on a GS frame.  Probably 90% of suv/cuv buyers have no idea how to handle a rwd vehicle.  It’s not worth the risk.
2413,It doesn't get much better than Tsuredure Children. It's a 10-minute episode series focusing on a handful of different couples. Not only do most of the stories involve the couple already dating (how novel!)  but the humor is great and relatable. And I say that as someone who generally finds romcoms boring.
2414,Detroit:  All manner of FCA V8 rule the streets.  Honestly literally everyone who is remotely interested has a Hellcat.  Nothing below a 392 (Even those I rarely see)   Mustangs and Camros less so.  Those are for old people or the white flight suburbs :P (just a joke there bud)  Its literally a video game at night most of the summer.
2415,So you didn't take it to Scotty for $100 and to have checked out with his fancy scan tool and check to see if there are any red indicators on the live data and test drive that the shocks are worn and doesn't ride as nice as his ES300/Matrix/94Celica?!?!
2416,Site crashes multiple times on my phone while trying to load the article and comments. Runs my battery down multiple percent per minute. They’ve ruined the mobile experience. Comments section is straight up toxic. Any alternatives with a similar digestible bits and pieces format?
2417,For Nvidia and all the 3rd parties there should be a sign up list combined with a lottery to pick who gets to buy and when. You sign up  you know you have a spot somewhere that'll eventually get called. You sign up with email  name  address and phone number. No duplication allowed in any of the fields. That should cut down on a lot. Its only a little bit of work but easy to do.

2419,If you are comfortable with Excel it's fine for midsized datasets  even if it's not generally considered best practice.   I would learn how to use PowerQuery/PowerPivot though. It comes stock with the 2016 version onward.
2420,If your game will have no fighting  what do you imagine the players to be doing on a regular basis? What sort of challenges will they be facing?  Knowing that will help to work out what stats the players might need.
2421,> driving at a safe speed  will their handling behaviors act any different or will that only happen once you reach their limits?  Cornering (without acceleration) is just about tires  aero and weight distribution  nothing else.  The only difference will be how much you can press the accelerator in curves before you lose control of the car and the way you do.  If you don't accelerate in curves and don't do something stupid like smashing the accelerator in high revs in a 500+hp car while going slow  there will be basically *no difference at all*.
2422,If you want a TTF  that generally means a vector font  and Photoshop creates raster images so you’d need to trace the outlines of your font somehow. If you want a raster (bitmap) font  then TTF is probably not the right path for you and you would want to figure something else out  probably specific to whatever engine you’re using.  To make a TTF  you need one of the tools like these: [https://beebom.com/free-tools-to-create-your-own-fonts/](https://beebom.com/free-tools-to-create-your-own-fonts/)  Note that if you have not created your own TTF before  there is a bit to learn  but it’s not crazy.
2423,It's a solid game to spend an afternoon with (I wrote up my play report [here](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/09/play-report-thousand-year-old-vampire.html).) Most of my entries were just one or two sentences  but it does a good job at getting your character moving and events flowing.
2424,Might be interesting  to see hire date  then how long has passed since  age  salary  term date  boolean for left or fired. Could predict term date.   But also see how many people are hired and still employed.   Could also group people by length of employment  and how many people leave at certain break points. 6 months  a year  5 years plus.   Also if you knew the market salary for those positions compared to how you pay. The could explain if under paid people leave.
2425,One shot Army of Darkness  played an old and broken Kung Fu Actor who'd only get crappy roles at the current stage of his career.  He was full of joy when pulled into a different time and became a Hero in this world by contributing to stop the Nazis from using the Necronomicon and preventing the Apocalypse. As in the movie  after saving the world you're brought back into your original time … and he was a nobody again.  Role-playing despair and announce: I kill myself. (Shoot myself in the head.)  GM: Roll for it.  *rattle rattle*  Crit Fail  GM: You pull the trigger and beyond a click nothing happens  upon checking the revolver  you see it's fully loaded. You shoot into the air and the gun works. Seems like you're time hasn't come yet.  We laughed so hard and it was a fitting end.
2426,One of my favourites a long time back was Kult. It often came across as very splatter punk because one element of it was riding of the popularity of Clive Barker's Cenobites from Hellraiser  but it could be played much more subtly than that.  Quite often our games played with perception and the characters and the players often had hard times figuring it which were which. Various people in our group tried Gm'ing it and they all brought their personal horror tastes with them  and the system allowed each of them to do what they wanted to do pretty easily.   Although I've got the new edition I haven't had a chance to sit down and play it yet  but I look forward to it.
2427,Interesting. On the 3090 board you can see there is an option for MLCC or normal cylindrical capacitors. The Bykski 3090 block says it only supports boards with CLCC capacitors and the shape of the block seems to agree. EK's 3090/3080 blocks don't mention this but also don't seem to support cylindrical capacitors  but the 3080 board doesn't seem to support MLCC capacitors. So it seems that for the 3090  on top of reference vs non-reference PCB  there is a question of what capacitors it uses  and for the 3080 reference  it can't use 3090 blocks that don't accept cylindrical capacitors. IMO it means finding a reference 3080 and a compatible block has just become harder than expected.
2428,The Midderlands for Fifth Edition has passed its funding goal and raised over $10k (£8k) with over 250 backers.  Thanks so much to those of you that have supported it so far.

2429,"If you're going to railroad your players  firstly you should make sure they're on board with that. Second  don't shoot yourself in the foot by gating the next plot point behind something they can fail  and if you do  thirdly  have a second railroad as backup in case they fall off the first track. It makes things feel like less of a railroad if they find this other thing going on that connects them back up to the main story. And as someone else suggested  think ""modular"" or ""reusable""  which is sometimes referred to as ""plan situations  not stories"". a klingon bird of prey decloaks  or receiving a distress call  those kinds of things fit anywhere and lead to more things."
2430,> We've expanded that a lot  with the upped resolution and framerate to 4K and 60FPS  and **added in four-player split-screen**  which is like rendering four copies of the game at once on a single console. It's fricking cool  man.   I don't care if you whip your dick out and tell me it's the greatest revolution in gaming history  just bring back split-screen co-op for god's sake.
2431,> The Project  > This is the release of the A2O POWER processor core RTL and associated FPGA implementation (using ADM-PCIE-9V3 FPGA). See [Project Info](https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2o/blob/master/rel/readme.md) for details.  > The Core  > The [A2O core](https://github.com/openpower-cores/a2o/blob/master/rel/doc/A2O_UM.pdf) was created to optimize single-thread performance  and targeted 3+ GHz in 45nm technology. It is a 27 FO4 implementation  with an out-of-order pipeline supporting 1 or 2 threads. It fully supports Power ISA 2.07 using Book III-E. The core was also designed to support pluggable implementations of MMU and AXU logic macros. This includes elimination of the MMU and using ERAT-only mode for translation/protection.
2432,Nice write up. Displaylink can work really well with a single screen.  I work in IT and deal with Displaylink adapters frequently. Usually it's with laptops with only 1 display output but no USB-C with video passthrough  for users who want to use two external monitors. They will get a USB 3.0 to HDMI displaylink adapter or a displaylink based port replicator with HDMI and DVI.  The primary issues we have with Displaylink is bugs between it and Windows display configuration. On many systems  if the system goes to sleep  the displaylink monitors do not wake up correctly with the system.  And then the other issue is that when you unplug and re-plug the displaylink adapter  Windows forgets the display configuration (like how the monitors are arranged on the Display diagram in Windows). Leading to the users needing to re-configure their displays every time they plug into their displaylink based port replicators. This isn't a problem if they are only using the displaylink screen. but if they are using the laptop screen and a screen on displaylink  if the monitor is physically positioned to the left  or above the laptop screen  they have to go into Windows Display menu and drag it back to it's relative position every time.  If you have a laptop with USB-C with video passthrough  I always recommend using that first because it uses the system's normal onboard graphics instead of installing a second display adapter like Displaylink does. There will be less of these little issues to deal with.
2433,I appreciate the precautionary language from Amazon  but those preorders still sold out very fast  so I can't imagine they did something like list infinite stock for a while or something. I imagine many (most?) people who ordered will receive their units at launch.
2434,"For analysis R is fine. I agree some of the analysis workflow is very convenient. However I thought the same thing about Matlab (I've used it heavily in the past). The problem is hardly anyone wants to write production code with Matlab and the same is true for R.  If you are writing software Python is better. If you have a team of data scientists prototyping things  and a team of engineers turning it into some scalable application  then it makes a lot of sense for everyone to be using Python. It's a ""glue"" language in more ways than one.  The data scientists get the convenient scientific stack to quickly work in (relatively speaking). The engineers turning data science code into production software can read the data scientists code  and also make calls out to more appropriate libraries or languages such as Go or C if the problem demands it. It glues together a team so they can speak the same language  more or less  but it also glues together other languages/libraries that are not written in Python.  Beyond that you can use Python to make any kind of software. It's much more customizable  in terms of the software you can put together  and the analysis workflow is acceptable. For what it's worth Pyspark dataframes and dot notation is not that different than tidyverse  and it's got way more bells and whistles for big data processing.  R is a programming language  there is a package manager  but it's more of an environment like Matlab than it is a replacement for Python.  Where R does seem to beat Python is the fact that you statistics people tend to create cutting edge statistical methods for inference or whatever else first in R. There's been several times where I legitimately can't find some method from a paper anywhere else.  I'm an applied math person  academically  not that statistics isn't also applied math. Hence I come at this from a different angle. Im a scientific computing generalist first and statistician only when I have to be."
2435,"Ok  that was funny. She's just annoying enough to leave an impression  not enough to make one's skin crawl. And who thought Odin can be this cute.   Tho with such a dire end-of-world premonition  I can't help but feel this has some Angel Beats spin to it  [Angel Beats spoiler](/s ""where the god is helping MC move on before it's too late"")"
2436,Lots of other posts here explain why pretty well  but I will reiterate in a parent comment: Don't drive it. Don't start it. Just leave it.  Store it. Store it properly. Save money on insurance. Sell those winter tires unless you will actually use the car in the winter regularly.
2437,"My question is a variation on ""what book should I start with?"" I started reading ""Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python"" by Joel Grus  but it just seems so haphazard and simultaneously dense and sparse  like a bunch of notes thrown together without much explanation  that I found it really discouraging. Is there a much better book to get started with  for someone who has some knowledge of Python already?"
2438,It's pretty easy. The system-agnostic parts are designed to work regardless of the system you use  so you can just mix and match that. Kevin Crawford does an excellent job of making random tables and each book has something different to offer with its tables. Character rules and character classes are easy to import since most of his games run on either the SWN 1e or 2e chassis. Sine Nomine games also have simple and elegant rules that you can slot onto any OSR game  like the Fray Die or Slaughter Die. Monsters can be used freely  although importing something like a Titanic Beast from Godbound into SWN is a bit...inadvisable. For the most part  you can frankenstein your ideal Sine Nomine game pretty easily.  However  let's talk about the parts that don't always work so well. Most of Sine Nomine's games have faction systems and each faction system is designed specifically for each game. They are all subtly different enough that you need to choose which one to use or to convert things. Godbound operates on an entirely different scale to the other games so importing character rules to the PCs there needs some careful consideration.
2439,"Might want to take a look at Night's Black Agents  specifically its ""Conspyramid"" rules  which are pretty adaptable to other systems.  The conspyramid is basically a structure for creating an in-game conspiracy in such a way that players can work their way through the key players and ultimately bring it down  while also modeling the conspiracy's responses as it realizes that it is under threat."
2440,I'd say its less to do with tech vs non tech and more to do with who runs the DS team. Non tech companies with DS teams tend to be older and larger businesses who invest in DS just because that's what everyone else is doing. These teams often tend to function like analysts just because the people who run them usually don't know any better. This is just my personal opinion  but I strongly believe that the true value of DS lies in embedding algorithms in applications rather than building power point presentations.
2441,*Solo*  a *Cepheus Engine* (*Traveller*) supplement by Zozer games is good for this. It's intended as a solo RPG campaign generator  but it comes across as a series of writing prompts more than anything else... If I had it in me to to *Traveller* style fiction  this would be awesome. Because it's system-specific  it presumes that one has the base game  but even without it  it can be a good idea generator.
2442,"In fact Unity is originally 3D and relatively feature complete.  What is recently confusing users is that they use and expose (or ""propose"" I should say) early preview features like URP/HDRP and DOTS that now since around 2018 iterate towards new tech/tools and start gradually aiming towards AAA developers or large scale high fidelity scenes (HDRP/DOTS)  too.  You could try without URP until it's final  like I guess other shipped very polished games did like Ori.  True that server-client FPS multiplylayer is not built-in anymore  most use Photon (PUN2?) or Mirror it seems.  I have 8 years experience with Unreal on large teams (80 to 200 roughly) before switching to Unity recently. I am not 100% sure if I'd use Unreal again when working alone or on much smaller teams.  I have to admit that I didn't have time to learn all the artists/animator's workflows on UE4  with Unity it's easy in the sense that I feel that I have a better overview of the game code and asset (import/settings) related features after 3 months. When I hit a wall even with DOTS the answer is often right there (community or Unity's forum)."
2443,Compared to software engineering  I don't think data science bootcamps are worth it just because hiring managers really expect job applicants to have an MS or PhD in something quantitative.     All the data scientists I know who just have undergrad degrees have experience as data analysts and data engineers already.
2444,Either I get way too surprised by what my players are coming up with and try too hard to come up with something that saves them  or I make NPCs that are way too strong and I make a deus ex machina on the fly to save them.
2445,"I've found SAS can be very quick with big data. And the macros allow for some pretty complex workflows and tailored output just like functions in R. I'm not real familiar with other languages  but I think I like them both.   It almost seems like the Apple vs Android debate made over for analysis. Yes  SAS limits you  but it is good at what it does and their are folks who settle into it's framework without needing or wanting extra functionality. R and other languages programs are more adaptable and have the ability for more intensive ""fiddling"" / ""hacky"" methodologies  and have a variety of not originally included functionality. But when it comes down to it  they all languages are tools in a toolbox."
2446, its a great way to share your knowledge  especially for something novel and will stay up long after your personal site goes down  one minor caveat:  please don't be part of the problem.... there are too many badly written medium articles with plagiarized projects
2447,Python or R requires it to be installed  something to schedule the runs etc. Sharing requires the other person to have it installed too (and correct versions).  SQL is popular because you can find it wherever you can find data (data tends to live in databases) and can do everything you need on that end.  Excel is popular because everyone has excel installed. You can email the file and anyone can edit it if they want to (which is sometimes a bad thing because they'll break it).
2448,Hello!   My name is Steve Bromley  and I am a games user researcher and author. (You can read more about me on my website to check my credentials! www.stevebromley.com)  I'm looking to run 1 on 1 interviews with 5-10 game developers about their process for game development  with a particular focus on what parts of the process you decide to outsource and why. I'm interested in hearing from both indies and people who work in large teams.  The conversations will be anonymous. I'd like to record them so that I don't have to take notes  but the recording will just be for my own use  to help inspire future blog posts and projects. I will never reveal who has participated  or what you tell me (unless you want me too)!   The chats will be around 30-45 minutes  scheduled at your convenience  and I'd like to pay you for your time - $25USD or an equivalent in your local currency.  If you are interested  I'm looking to talk to people from a variety of backgrounds - please fill out the below form so that I can pick a mixture of people (including people who don't outsource work currently). There are no right or wrong answers  so do be honest.  I'll try and get in touch with the people selected next week to schedule a time that works for you.  If interested  here's a sign-up form so I can make sure I'm seeing a mixture of people: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefyl20jr95W57PxMNDEfv8kTAdx_nJWybtGBhU17tCQn_YHw/viewform?usp=sf_link  DM or comment with any questions  happy to chat!

2453,It's interesting how Sony  Microsoft and Nintendo are creating their own lanes in gaming to try and find profitability. It's a lot better than companies trying to sell you the same experience on a different box.
2454,Most of the time OE or high quality aftermarket performance. On my wife’s X5 I’ll use Zimmerman and some other non-OE stuff because it has good reviews. Though I have run a few sets of cheap Federal street/track tires and have been impressed for the money.
2455,"D&D 5E is honestly pretty above average at this.  D&D 4E and Savage Worlds both have ""minion rules"" that let you not track HP for individual figures that aren't that important. In D&D 4E minions have 1 HP  did you hit them? Then they're gone. In Savage Worlds they're either ""fine"" or ""stunned"" (which means next hit takes them out) and you can denote ""stunned"" by laying the mini on its side.   D&D 4E has also *tons* of character abilities that are dependent on or manipulate positioning  to the point where it gets reminiscent of a Strategy RPG videogame sometimes."
2456,My friend tested his Igame 3080 Advanced with 6 POSCAP and 0 MLCC thing. When not touching anything this 3080 hovers around 1850 up to 1950Mhz. When pressing the OC button at back of the card it sits to 1995Mhz and below and its running fine  when he add up +20Mhz on core clock it crashed. We can safely assume that this 3080 is not a good overclocker but out of the box the boost clock said its 1855Mhz stated in the site so for me its totaly fine if couldnt hit the 2Ghz mark. I preordered this Igame  now i canceled it but still thinking if i did the write thing
2457,CPU's already have instruction/data cache. These caches are of few different levels with increasing size but decreasing speed. As mentioned in other comment xilinx aquisition is relevant to HPC. Your idea of chaching is very valid but they have already thought of it. More details here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache
2458,https://www.anandtech.com/show/15029/micron-finally-announces-a-3d-xpoint-product-micron-x100  Seems to be a datacenter product. I doubt its in the consumer market. If it is  prices will likely be nightmare inducing.  For reference  a 2017 optane 280gb optane drive has a $389 msrp.
2459,I have 2 computers and one of them doesn't have a cd-rom (low-end) but the other one has. I will turn the low-end pc to Windows XP but I only have windows XP **CD**.   Is it possible to turn that Win XP cd to USB so I can use it on my low end?
2460,To get a bit of variety I would go with some mix of the following:  1. Dogs in the Vineyard or In a Wicked Age.  2. Mouseguard  3. My Life With Master  4. Sorcerer  5. Apocalypse World or Monsterhearts or Blue Beards Bride  6. Blades in the Dark or Scum and Villainy  7. Fate (Fate Core  Dresden Files Accelerate  Fate of Cthulu  Atomic Robo  or Fate of Agaptus)  8. Smallville (or Cortex Drama)  9. Lady Blackbird  8. Mutant Year Zero  Genlab Alpha or Tales from the Loop  So many good games left out! I should add Mage the Ascension  Delta Green  The One Ring  L5R...If you were playing more than a few sessions  Burning Wheel would be a must!
2461,I run a zombie survival game set in my hometown every halloween. The players can do more or less whatever they want. But I keep notes on their actions.  In the course of the game  they may encounter the players from previous years. At this point there's 5 different parties fighting their way around the city. I ususally base the session off of Forged in the Dark nowadays because it is rules lite. But having access to floorplans for real buildings gives you maps. It's easy to come up with plot beats based off of random observations from living in your town. And I usually only reveal at the end that the people they've been brought into conflict with were players from the past. Then my players get stoked that their session will be immortalized every year.
2462,Things that already have turbo variants  or are overbuilt from the factory. Toyota/Lexus engines  BMW N54 and N55. Honda stuff from the 90s is pretty bulletproof too.  A lot of the Nissan/Infiniti stuff sucks with forced induction. The engines were just never meant to be abused like that  or make huge power.
2463,"So I recently created a wholly original space opera game/campaign on Roll20  but it has a twist to make it more fun and bespoke: It's going to be like a sci-fi grindhouse movie come to rpg life. I'm a huge fan of the Heavy Metal comics and both movie adaptations  so it's sorta a source of inspiration.  I'm aiming for this to have 28 playable core races tops  and have good ol' graphic violence scenarios w/ a morality bar that a PC falls under based on species alone. That leads to certain attribute bonuses somehow. Thus I want this to be a game where players can relate to a race and say ""I'mma make my go-to with this!""  The game currently utilizes the Fate system  and I'm going all out so it'll be 18+. Honestly  I somehow feel Fate won't rock hard enough. This was supposed to originally be a Marvel space-based campaign admittingly.  Advice?"
2464,When your main game supports RTXio  AMD equivalent  or DirectStorage API.    Don't know if RTXio requires it or is it's own thing ahead of MS launch.  In the RTXio announcement it said DirectStorage API won't be launching until next year.
2465,I was set on getting an 8c/16t CPU this time  but not sure I will anymore. $600 CAD is a bit too high for my liking for a CPU.  I might go with the 5600X. Sure it'll have less cores than the consoles  but I'm hoping the higher IPC will still provide better performance. I'd probably go with Intel (10700K) if they had PCIe 4.0.
2466,Yeah  I just can't get into these games that sound more like improv workshops or encounter groups or some sort of confrontational group therapy  than an evening of lighthearted fun. I deal with my emotional pain in my real life and would sort of like to leave it behind in my gaming space.
2467,I think it's understandable and mostly valuable for people to offer their own solutions to problems. This can and will be abused. Unfortunately  with all problems that affect a community  you have two primary choices: stop all of it because of a few abusers  or approach each individual who abuses it  discuss  and then take action if it doesn't stop. The former is the simple solution that fixes the problem but at the expense of everyone who doesn't abuse it. The latter is an ongoing effort that takes diligence and confrontation and so is harder to execute.
2468,I don't work at one  but I know the tech industry in general. I think one of the biggest issues is the culture of expecting unreasonable commitment. A lot of companies  if not most  have gotten better. But it's still around.   I recently turned down a full time job and took a pay cut because I wanted more time for gardening. I'm a better developer because of it. Work life balance matters.   People also value having work they can be proud of. Which  for a company  can mean a commitment to standing by the quality of their product. Some studios aren't so good at that.
2469,My planes travelling campaign is going to take a nautical turn soon as the players are about to visit Freeport. They have requested a base of operations or community that they can grow  care about and be attached to  and a ship seems like an ideal way of providing this.  So I plan on giving them access to a ship that is to become theirs. This ship is going to be able to travel between planes  but at the cost of investment and effort. I’m not sure how to pull this off  so some suggestions and ideas would be welcome!  Heres what I want it to do:  I’d like this ship to be a base of operations and possibly a home. Ideally the players should be able to upgrade and expand this ship somehow  possibly by investing gold  time and likely by going on missions.  I want this ship to be able to travel between the Plane of Shadow and the Prime Material at first  but ultimately it should be able to reach any plane of existence. The planar travelling doesn’t have to be represented by rules or follow any established mechanics  as it’s largely a plot device. I was thinking of giving the ship special sails that can be attuned to planes of existence. Choosing which plane to travel to becomes a matter of swapping sails  which is a process that takes hours.  I’d like the NPC followers the players have to have significant roles on the ship  possibly providing bonuses to things like skill checks and tests related to the ship and travels. I also want this ship to make the players want to find cool new NPC followers to hang around the characters and be the crew of this ship.  For reference  this is a City of 7 Seraphs campaign focused on travelling between Prime Material planes and visiting new  exciting cities. What I’d love frok you guys are suggestions on how to make an upgradeable ship-base thats fun for the players to tinker with  and that encourages the characters to care about it and their NPC follower crewmates.  Any ideas?
2470,I don't know how true whole thing is and I hope we find out soon* but I find it interesting that [according to TechPowerUp photos Palit went with one array of those more expensive caps](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/palit-geforce-rtx-3080-gaming-pro-oc/3.html) for just $10 over MSRP ($710).      \*[edit: it's true](https://forums.evga.com/m/tm.aspx?m=3095238&p=1)
2471,"We have a lot of Tableau dashboards at my company.  Most of the data sources for them are SQL databases or are some proprietary software which we use SSIS to ETL dumps into SQL on an evening schedule.  However  some data is housed in manual user spreadsheets and I don't really see the ability to take it out of the equation.  Typically these data must be edited often based on new information and are not a clean cut calculation which can be automated.    Does anyone have any recommendations for some best practices that could either lock down these spread sheets as a data entry tool or replace them with something better?  We have a lot of ""user spreadsheets"" that are creeping into reports/dashboards as data sources across the organization and I'm having a hard time thinking of a better solution."

2475,Maybe your next portfolio project is to learn a little about business structure and model business processes  and even inject some dummy data of sales/other business data into the model and run analytics on it. This would showcase your skills and business acumen all at once.
2476,No. It stalled on PC 2012-2017 when Intel stopped offering higher core counts and AMD was floundering around with Bulldozer  but it picked right back up once competition restarted.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Kxj9VrtUlWnVlDa9fUVlyM9U177tRWH9ZbhAZh67q0/edit#gid=0  Similar happened in servers  despite the obvious demand for manycore CPUs. Again  once the opportunity became available to buy good CPUs with more cores for reasonable prices  people bought them.  People won't program for cores they can't buy  so the hardware has to come first. There's no fundamental blocker to using  say  32 cores in common applications  except those that just fundamentally don't need the horsepower.
2477,I'll wait for benchmarks for my final evaluation but RTX3xxx is clearly overhyped already. I was excited for the 3070 but I'm def gonna wait to see how it compares to big navi and the xbsx  if the xbsx isn't far behind the 3070/big navi i might just lean that way and pick up a new GPU next year once there are hopefully some sales
2478,For what it's worth  the latest Drivers claim to have improved stability for RTX 30 series GPUs. Might take a couple days to get the testing and results out there  but some users are already saying that this driver fixes their crashing.  It'd be really funny if the problem came down to be software/firmware/driver related after everyone sharpened their pitchforks over capacitors.

2482,Depending on the size of the database the simplest may be to deliver a literal sqllite file and let them convert it to whatever db system they use.   If that’s not feasible  you could make a generic ansi sql DDL script that creates the database structure and then a series of DML scripts to insert into the various tables created by the DDL. That should run in many db systems.   If you know their specific database  you could just create a backup file from that system and let them restore it into their network.
2483,It's not really the most comfortable car (i have a 997.1 c2s).   A lot of people try to race you for no reason.   Draws attention if you drive like anything other than a saint.   Parts are expensive! Over a beans for a new set of tires  over a grand for brake rotors and pads  almost 9 quarts of oil per oil change.   Requires premium gas and the tank only lasts about 260 miles.
2484,DTRPG has “Under Western Skies” by Michael Brown. It is 2d6  Cepheus Engine based. There are a few scenarios for it - but note they’re quite brief  like a lot of Michael B’s stuff. Cepheus stuff is also fairly compatible with other 2d6 systems  with more or less work (depends on the system).   Cepheus descends from Classic Traveller. It is (in-)famous for its lifepath/career system. If you had it  and the above  I think you’d be able to adapt your own system quite easily if you found Under Western Skies a bit too simple.  The Classic Traveller Starter set is currently free from DTRPG  if you want to take a look. Check it out  [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80190/CTSTStarter-Traveller?term=Classic+traveller+starter)  PS: there is a D20 Traveller supplement for the T20 version of Traveller — “Personal Weapons of Charted Space” — that you might find useful if you get both the above. It has weapon stats for a variety of tech levels  and it includes stats for Classic Traveller as well as T20. So to make the best use of it  you’d probably need the starter set as well to see how those weapons work in original CT.  You might find another publication  Cowboys vs Xenomorphs  to be useful. Or not. It does take a Western setting and introduce SF elements  so if that isn’t remotely what you’re answer  stick with the other stuff I mentioned above. It is an adventure that takes Traveller characters and sets them in the wild west. The title gives away an SF style twist. I got it because the very first Traveller campaign I ran was for the descendants of marooned Scouts in the Traveller Universe: 300 years later  the world was a version of ‘the wild west’.
2485,It *looks* okay  but I'm not totally sure.  On the right is a metal plate - the end of the graphics card  and I can't quite see whether the tip of that is seated in the appropriate hole in the enclosure.  If it is  then everything is allright.
2486,Just because it has a turbo does not mean the engine itself is all of sudden quiet. It's still there. The turbo is an addition.  Some cars just play a car sound through your speakers depending on your RPM (like a videogame)  for example Peugeot does it and it's quite cringy once you realise it  but I highly doubt a 4.0 V8 does that.  My car is only a three cylinder turbo and it has no fake engine sound  but I can still hear it rev nice and clear.
2487,I used classic traveller for alien (and other stories) inspired games. Later  over the edge 2e. Then mongoose traveller 1e. The descendant of mongoose traveller 1e  Cepheus Engine  has Hostile and related supplements for an Aliens style universe. So  given that  while I’ve only read SWN I’d say it could cope with an Alien style game. Especially since you’ve got a lot of good source / background info if you have the Alien RPG. I’d say the other games I mentioned would work well too (imho).
2488,"Call of Cthulhu? The system isn't intended to be combat focused  in fact  getting into a fight may leave a couple of characters dead. The ""sanity loss"" system isn't terrible  either  especially if you're not constantly pitting your players against Things Man Should Not Know."
2489,GURPS by sheer weight  although it's got a lot of sliders to control how crunchy you want it to be (tech level  which books you're actually using  etc.). Shadowrun is very crunchy partially due to basic rules and more so because of all the subsystems that require rules of their own (magic and all of ITS subsystems  hacking  technomancy  rigging).  Then there's Exalted. Oof  Exalted. Two full campaigns of Second Edition under our belts with practically every Exalt type accounted for. There's a lot to read  that's for sure.
2490,"This is just anecdotal evidence  but I keep my Hankook RS4 (200TW) year round on my Miata. On my daily I run Continental ECS's  and here in Texas most people will run the same wheel+tire all year.  We regularly hang around freezing and sometimes dip below that. I've done track days in normal summer tires at below freezing conditions  plenty of people had EHP tires there with no issues. I've driven my RS4's in freezing temperatures before and my car sits outside. 4 sets of tires  none ever had any compound cracking. Is the grip less? Yeah it is. Still grips up better than a ""normal"" summer tire does in mild conditions though.   I wouldn't worry about your tires too much. If you're really wigged out  just inspect them whenever you stop next and see if you notice anything funky."
2491,"If you set your goal as ""Play D&D from levels 1-20 in an intricately crafted and plotted campaign "" then you won't know if that ""worked"" until the campaign ends. So at least a few years from now  depending on how quickly your group plays.   If you set your goal as ""Play a single adventure/""arc"" in D&D "" then you'll know as soon as one of those adventures/""arcs"" is complete—probably within a month? If it works  you can keep trying to do the same sort of thing. If it doesn't  you can change course and try something else with your campaign."
2492,Mononoke will fit the bill. It is about a medicine seller who exercises yokai. Although to do that he needs info on the ghost so while finding out the reason for their existence can be super fucked up and dark. I mean the first arc is as dark as it gets. Also very few anime have done this for me but some arcs give you a sense of unease and somewhat scared.   It has a beautiful and unique art style that is second to none. Also the performance from the va of the medicine seller is top notch. Also the anime can get very philosophical about subjects each arc tackles.   You do not see many talk about it nowadays so I think it is a hidden gem for sure. It was one of the very few anime I want to buy a physical version but it does not seen to be easily sold. I suggest checking it out
2493,My Elantra makes a weird steering noise. After driving for a while the steering area makes a weird crackling sound. It is exacerbated by bumpy roads seemingly. Sounds at first glance like crinkling wrappers  but listening closer it definitely sounds like electricity in there  maybe shorting something. Any idea what it might be? The problem goes away after the car sits off for a while.
2494,I understand why BMW would offer it but I don't quite understand how someone would want it over it's bigger brother with the exception being the relative rarity the M2CS would offer.  M2's are great driver's cars but they're also cheaper made and feeling than an M4 by a large margin. For the same money  someone can order/have a superbly spec'd F82 M4 which only weights fractionally more than the M2CS and they get quite a bit more car from the same company.  I think the M2 CS is quite lovely and I am sure it's a dream to drive. But I could not bring myself to buy one at that price (says the guy who ordered a $92k M3 😂).
2495,I guess it really depends on the jurisdiction and the cops attitude that day? I was told in GA the state patrol only tickets 10+ over but I'm not 100% sure if that's true. City cops/sheriff's deputies might ticket for going 5 over  esp in small towns that could use the money stream tbh.
2496,20% Mustangs  20% Camaro/Corvettes  20% Challengers/Chargers  10% Old American Cars including kit Cobras  20% Subaru WRXs exclusively  3% Porsche  2% VW (usually just me with my Golf)  1% Audi  2% BMW  2% Supercars like McClarens/Ferraris/Lambos
2497,**Rstudio as Python IDE?**  I tried creating a new post with this question  but I don't have enough karma... So here it is.  So I've been using Rstudio for quite some time when using R. I know a bit of python  used it a long time ago  and back then I wrote my code using IDLE. Now I have a couple of projects that will be using both R and python and I saw that Rstudio now has support for python. Has anyone used Rstudio with python  is it worth it? How easy is it to setup? And to use? Or do you suggest another IDE?
2498,It's uncommon  but you can write data processing in Go that's called by a main process written in C# or something.  Go is a mix of C and Python that focuses on simplicity and clarity.  It scales well for large projects though it relies on composition over inheritence for its flavor of OOP.  The garbage collector is a red flag for most  though I find Go's to be incredibly lean and it shouldn't affect your runtime any more than C# does.  Its biggest downside for game development is that C calls are expensive so it scales poorly for graphics programming.  Edit: It's

2500,Now this season feels more like an even sided battle where a lot of show can contend for the top spot. Though I have a feeling Higurashi could've easily dominated the top spot if it wasn't split into two discussion threads.  Love that ToniKawa is on 3rd. We're all gonna need Insulin shots after this. I am already getting a super insane urge to get married immediately.  Also  I am eagerly waiting for Jun Maeda's The Day I Became a God to air today. Hopefully it will deliver and at least contend for top 5 this season!
2501,PSA: On graphics cards they are SP-CAPS not POSCAPS - POSCAPS are a very specific product (or brand name) by panasonic and rarely appear on graphics cards. The correct term is SP-CAPS. Stop calling them POSCAPS.
2502,To evangelize Apache Superset  I've been working on writing a series of blog posts that walkthrough how to create dashboards to understand & visualize community health (crucial for OSS projects).

2503,If possible get you one where you can bring your own parts  also make sure they have a shop  doesn't need to be fancy  don't let some Craigslist traveling boat mechanic get in over his head and cost you an extra 350.
2504,it does sound like a dead hard drive  have you tried removing the hard drive and just booting off the hard drive because it looks like it is just the SSD playing up. if this works you can safely say you don't need to spend 40 quid on a new hard drive and just need a new SSD
2505,Hold up so I first brought this game for my xbox 360  then again for my ps4 cause it was on sale cheap... Now they want me to buy it a third time for a third console generation?   It's craziness... Rockstar used to be so amazing  money corrupts all apparently.
2506, I've recently noticed that I've been getting significantly lower frame rates than I should do. I'm not sure how long this has been happening because I haven't been checking frame rates that I get against what a GTX1080 ti should be getting  I only noticed it when I went back to an older game whos frame rate I remembered used to be higher (AC odyssey). I ran two benchmarks  the first AC odyssey built-in benchmark where It recently scored 31 FPS compared to 39FPS last year  the second was 3D mark where I got a graphics score of 7906 when it should be around 9930. Drivers are up to date and everything. Temps are fine although 3d mark and odyssey didn't seem to max the temps out as I thought they used to  it stuck below 70  I've played games where it reached 75 before pretty quickly. I haven't messed with fan curves or anything. CPU utilisation is at 30% on the odyssey and GPU usage is at 100% these haven't changed. Nothing's overclocked  Specs:  8700k  GTX1080ti  16Gb 2400Mhz  corsair 850 watt PSU  I can't work out what's wrong  |I'm worried it may be a hardware problem  it's still in warranty so not a massive issue just annoying if it is hardware related. If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate the input.
2507,I would honestly use a shader in combination with sprite scaling and a particle effect to do this. It'd be more work up front  but you'd have something generic you can apply to anything you want the affect on  especially given you're not animating it very much.
2508,Aside from being as thorough and diligent in their testing as anyone could hope for and providing data that is as authoritative as it gets  I’ve found that nothing helps me sleep easier than putting on one of their videos covering something that I have absolutely no interest in at all. Their upcoming Ampere and Big Navi coverage will have me attentively watching every second and learning exciting information and then I can pop on a couple vids about cases or whatever I have no personal interest in buying or learning about and sleep like a baby.  GN truly is a blessing!
2509,I'm more often the one making the mash-ups. Probably my favorite (and the most fitting example) was the time I had a team of superheroes face a dragon/A-10.  For another GM's creation  the closest thing I can think of is pretty similar to someone else's post: a giant yuki-onna.

2511,I dig it! I was curious how the d6 was going to manifest  and then impressed by the quick “assign 1-4” for the attributes  and when it turned out it was d6 roll under I actually said “oh wow” out loud. I’m not familiar with a ton of micro rpgs  but this is super sleek but robust and flexible. Also  I’m not sure if I know of any other d6 roll under games?  I’m not sure I’d ever get a chance to play it  but I could see how you could get a game up and running in minutes with this  and be able to get multiple sessions or episodes out of what you have here. And it really hits that “science disaster blockbuster” vibe just right. This is very cool  good job.
2512,I was hype for a few minutes but I don’t feel like the design fits. I guess I’m too much a fan of the original.  Edit: To clarify  I feel like this is trying for 80’s vaporwave when it should be old school arcade style.  64 bit with resolution support  with monsters that scared me like ZAMN had. I don’t want to be too wordy  but I don’t get the same feeling with this art style.  Title art is dope tho.
2513,I feel this a lot working on my first project. Like as I progress through more scripting  I'm constantly thinking I could do this better  and saying to people that I will redo the code. So far I've only re-written an entire script  a module and had to fix all my animators to accommodate the changes  all to reduce the script by 20 lines  reduced coupling and improved readability  and I'm still thinking it could be better.
2514,Toploaders can probably handle that just fine  especially if you go for the heavier duty  higher spline count big input 4 speeds. The 390 they were behind stock made ~430 lb ft  so I can imagine they would be able to stand up to it. If you don't care about gear ratios then a T-18/19 from an old pickup will probably be cheaper  easier to find  and about as stout. First gear will be stupid low  but second is still 3:1 or so and with a ~3.27 final drive you would be pretty close to your 10:1.

2516,"The ""Take the sci-fi approach"" method folk here are talking about is actually very helpful.  My most successful foray into the genre was by running Spelljammer  which I leaned _very_ heavily on Sci-Fi for. Guns  magic computers  mages as artillery  etc. It was sci-fi with a fantasy veneer.   ""Fantasy with a Sci-Fi veneer"" is the one that's proven difficult. I could see approaching it like He-Man/She-Ra? It just seems like whatever approach is taken  the thread of medieval pretense becomes unravelled. Is any of it actually medieval any more?"
2517,Even if there are data engineers  you as a scientist will be using the data platform they set up. If you have knowledge of it you can be a lot more efficient and help yourself if there are issues rather than being blocked.  Data scientist has become quite a broad term  but if you are the kind of data scientist that writes code  it's very useful to have software engineering skills just to be able to run good experiments. Some of the pitfalls of data scientists in industry is poorly structured code bases  lack of version control  logging automation etc. All of these things are helped by learning some good engineering practices.
2518,"I don't have a clear advice between the two choices you gave  but I wanted to address some of your comments -  &#x200B   >but I'm not doing any data science - just building pipelines  dashboards  and recommending improvements to data architecture  What is ""doing any data science"" in your standards? You're saying you are ""just"" building pipelines  dashboards  etc. but these are good tools have in data science. I wouldn't downgrade the importance.  &#x200B   >all of my strategic input is shot down via manager telephone (e.g. ""I asked and the VPs said they don't want to do that"" or ""I asked our boss and they say to not have conversations with the other team to gather requirements for your proposal to fix their data model"").  Your manager sounds toxic as hell. Having a good manager is critical to your career development. Personally this alone would be my reason to move on to a different company.  &#x200B   >but not so great with python or the more advanced SQL queries. I don't even have a public git repo where I show off my code to potential recruiters.   >   >I don't have and advance degree  I'm missing some languages  no clearance  no practical AI/ML/NLP/Regression experience.  This is something you can change on your own. Don't expect your employer to get you an advanced degree  github repo  fill you in on the missing languages or get you the experience you need for the next job. This is your responsibility - learn on your own if you're not learning on the job.  Maybe if you're feeling stuck and not hearing back from applications  you should work on these areas on your own. Your career is in your hands.  Edit: typo"
2519,Powertofly has a series of talk related to imposter syndrome.  It is a recurring topic  because is an issue that at least 70% of people has experienced signs and symptoms.

2520,Only 6 years too late. Why would they do a remastered at the end of the current console life cycles rather than beginning of next console life cycle? I mean they should have remastered these right as PS4 and Xbox One launched.
2521,I saw a lifted dually the other day with underlighting. The suspension was all chromed and painted  and he had those low profile tires on wide wheels that stick out of the fenders.  I don't understand the look. But I'm old. I'm not supposed to like it.

2523,Jun became 100% better this episode. Instead of being an overbearing hardass  she is now providing [insight](https://i.imgur.com/syHfCTm.png) on the competition  teaching Konomi [a new technique](https://i.imgur.com/9kvL4i0.png) and absolutely [destroying](https://i.imgur.com/CqiZTgT.png) the bitter cat girl.  I'm glad Konomi didn't make the finals  that would be way too OP even for such a talented newbie. We also got a much needed taste of what Sayo and Nonoka are capable of  as well as a sneak peek at the top competitors...*kuuru Kurusu!*~.  And speaking of [top competitors](https://i.imgur.com/eGBqoOK.png)...[OH MY GIRL](https://i.imgur.com/a2K1yws.png)!

2524,I don't drive so IDK lol. But my uncle takes me to town to skateboard on my days off. Well like when I wait for him and he pulls by the curb to pick me up  he has like a bad habit of rubbing his tires against the curb for like 3 feet. Is this bad for his tires or the car? Or does it just sound a lot worse than it is because standing outside the car while he pulls in makes like a terrible loud bulging squeaky balloon like noise and it's embarrassing but people like stare and stuff... Would definitely appreciate your input as I'm kinda curious.
2525,Sometimes different cars in different markets have the same name  and sometimes the same car has different names in different markets. What I would do is make sure the chassis is the same/see what regions got the same 97 Civic.
2526,I think bootcamps are good options for people with solid programming and math chops that haven't done a lot of work with more current machine learning stuff.  They are not a good substitute for having good programming and math chops though.
2527,**Gintama (rewatch)** up to ep 286  I'm firmly headed towards the endgame at this point. Even many of the comedy/one-off episodes are beginning to carry more meaning for the characters. Gintama is great  and I'm continuing to enjoy it a lot more my second time through.  **Railgun T** 25/25  Hands down the best season of Railgun  and likely the best RailDex anime to date (Though I didn't finish Index III and haven't watched the Accelerator anime yet). I was inspired to buy an E-reader and give the Index novels a real shot (previously tried to read them on my phone  but I hate reading on my phone. And at $20 CDN a pop  the paper volumes are way too expensive).
2528,Hello   I am a little confused right now about choosing my major and minor. I  want to have a career in data science and will be starting at my university from February 2021. Originally I had planned to take computer science as my major and data science as my minor but I wonder if that's going to affect me later on in finding jobs. I have thought of getting a job after completing my bachelor's so that I gain some experience but what will be the chances of getting one in the DS stream if I only complete my minors in it?
2529,I think perception of the car brand by the consumer biases problem reports. People are more likely to report problems with a brand like chevrolet as opposed to  say  toyota.   People tend not to buy camaros for reliable transport  though. If you want a fun daily  there are so many options out right now  even fwd family sedans.
2530,I absolutely adore *Smallville* for this. (along with any derivatives of it  like the short list of settings in the *Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide * and the possibilities imaginable with *Cortex Prime)*  the entire group collaborates with each other during the process  and the various character elements are laid out on a monstrous mind-map  with linking arrows turning the whole thing into a web full of plot hooks  NPCs  setting details  and inter-character connections. I don't think I've seen anything else quite like it.
2531,I think Steve freudian slipped that FE is miserable to disassemble again this year. Not intentionally  but the fact he brought it up as a possible talking point  then tried to cover it up as something we will find out later. Also noticed that the GN weekly news videos tend to have as few cuts as possible  which is why it was probably left in.
2532,They've been working on this game for how many years? Let's say 5. And they have to work 6 or 7 Saturdays over the course of those 5 years.   That seems.... Very reasonable. Even more so when you account for the extra pay and the sick bonus of 10% of all sales.
2533,Don't care  I just want VIIR2. My hope is though the future FF games use a similar battle system to VIIR. It's a very fun and strategic system overall and could be interesting with different magic and character development systems behind it. All the other FF games took so long to develop in part to not being able to figure out the battle system well.
2534,I can only speak generally  but SAS has been losing popularity over time. The only exception to this is for legacy use... which healthcare might fall under. I'm leaning towards R for being more useful (especially for scientific research fields) but I can see SAS being useful just because it's legacy.
2535,I'm making an isometric tactical RPG  and I'd like to open battles with some dramatic camerawork -- instead of just starting from the isometric view  maybe pan along a row of enemies  maybe rotate around some  and generally get a more dramatic view of the area. Might even try to do some during characters' actions to up the drama there.  However  I've found it really hard to make these look particularly good using a regular spline-based camera controller. It's a lot of manual effort to compose and the look/feel just isn't that great. I tried writing some scripts to pan and zoom between spaces and views  and same -- it just isn't feeling like professional cinematography. At worst it feels jerky  at best the framing just feels poor or it's kind of boring.  Does anyone know of any kind of resources for this  whether better tools or just reliable game cinematography techniques? Maybe favorite games that do this well?  This is in Unity (re: tools)  though I'm eager to learn from other systems as well.
2536,For calculus I recommend you watching professor Leonard Calculus playlist  and do the exercises with Calculus 1001. (U can find free pdf). As for Linear Algebra  I recommend you the book Linear Algebra and Its applications by Lay. There’s also some playlists in LA on youtube  and you can complement it with Khan academy. I like Dr Peyam playlist on LA. He explains very well the theory coupled with some exercises.
2537,Rust can usually only form when there is no paint.  White colored Rav4 were not primed properly in model years 2009 - 2013 and have a known issue for peeling paint.  Yours shouldn't have the problem  but it might be worth mentioning to the dealer.
2538,EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I realize that the data analyst/scientist is a hectic career. Still  if anyone would like to expand upon their answer  I'm building a website (https://www.pathviz.com/) to help people navigate various careers and make better decisions through ratings  reviews  and salary range info. The form takes 20+ minutes to fill out and could be an excellent resource for the r/datascience community.
2539,Offer to buy her out. Worst thing she can do is say no. If she agrees  then you can carry on with exclusive rights.  Doing so before it's a viable product or has made any money also means it's less valuable. Buying her out later could be a lot harder than it is right now.  Alternatively  if you can't reach a financial solution you could segment out the work she has done and re-do it yourself so that she has no work or intellectual property involved in the final product.
2540,Ok round two. I previously asked this sub for recommendations before I knew what I really wanted out of a game system and magic system  but now I have a much better idea.  The setting doesn’t really matter as long as it supports some kind of fantasy. The biggest thing for me is the magic system—I’d like a non-Vancian system with a more abstracted idea of spells that still allows for progression. For instance  imagine a pyromancer in the beginning can shoot fire bolts and maybe a fireball if they use more resources like mana points (or involve more risk in doing so)  but at will or for a very low cost they can manipulate already existing torch and match flames for utility or flavor. However  as the pyromancer gets stronger they still get the opportunity to take cool new spells and probably an increased mana pool.  There should also be mechanics for interesting martial combat  such as the ability to do certain maneuvers either in lieu of or addition to a standard attack.  I also the idea of alternate health systems  either HP thresholds that carry negative penalties or an injury/wound system.  I don’t want any system more complex than D&D 5e (as I feel each encounter takes too long)  and I don’t have the time to brew a system out of something like GURPS. FATE seems so abstract to me that PC’s don’t really feel different than one another. Light to medium crunch is preferable. I’ve considered Savage Worlds but I’m a bit worried about the nature of how whiff/ping the combat seems in addition to my players not liking the idea of losing actions on Shaken. I’d entertain some superhero systems if they’re not too high on the power level scale  it’s not low fantasy but I don’t want to get to the level of heroic D&D wizards.  I’m interested to know what systems you guys have in mind that could fit most or all of these criteria. Thanks!
2541,#YO!  So  I just finished **Martian Succesor Nadesico!**   It was... okay? Good even  but it's sort of in my 3/5 tier  where it's fun  but didn't really blow me away. It's got some charm  I do like the fourth-wall breaking humour and how light-hearted it is. But none of the characters really did anything for me  and the plot was a bit too silly and back-and-forth for me to really be invested in it.  I also started **Ore Monogatari**...  Dude... I'm only two episodes in  but this *is* the cutest  sweetest shit I've ever seen  and I freaking love it. I dunno why I'm putting off watching more  it's gonna melt my fucking heart I'm sure.
2542,I do this. Mine are at my website  [https://diceystories.com/](https://diceystories.com/). The writing helps me internalize what happened  and the other players provide feedback on the depictions of their characters.  There are a number of threads in the Roleplaying Actual Play forum of [RPG.net](https://RPG.net) that would also fit what you are asking about.
2543,I love that car. I've only seen one in person but when I was 14 or 15  8 years earlier I saw this music video in a barber shop of very close to this model of car and I think the band was korn - got the life. Its great seeing posts like this  brings back so many memories from things.
2544,Shadow of the Weird Wizard  Dolmenwood campaign setting  Whatever Free League has planned for The One Ring  And though it's not announced  confirmed or anything  I'd like to see what LaTorra has proposed for a Dungeon World 2e.     EDIT: Oh and the Dune RPG  because Dune  though I'm not excited to learn another system. (no knock on 2d20  it looks cool and all)  And Ironsworn : Starforge. Space combat system looked cool in the preview  and if anyone can pull off tactical combat in a narrative system it's Shawn Tomkin!
2545,Igor's Lab points to choice between POSCAPs and MLCCs in power delivery as possible source of 3080/3090 instability. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/izgqhd/the_possible_reason_for_crashes_and_instabilities/)) This is still speculative but as good a theory as any right now. Also  I am informed that POSCAPs are a specific Panasonic product line which isn't even used here  the correct term is really SMD polymer capacitor.  Here is a list of cards by balance of those components.  Product page sourcing may not accurately reflect release versions due to revisions not warranting redoing photo shoots. Some ASUS cards are known to have done this. Many reviewer models are also SP-CAP only as they are pre-production.  # 3070  &#x200B   |**AIB**|**Model**|**MLCC Groups**|**SP-CAPs**|**Source**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Asus|Dual||4|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/DUAL-RTX3070-8G/gallery/)| |Asus|Dual OC||4|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RTX3070-O8G-GAMING/gallery/)| |Asus|Strix||4|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RTX3070-8G-GAMING/gallery/)| |Asus|Strix OC||4|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RTX3070-O8G-GAMING/gallery/)|  The layout is different from 3080 and 3090  so it is difficult to determine at this time which components are MLCCs and what constitutes a group of them.  # 3080  &#x200B   |**AIB**|**Model**|**MLCC Groups**|**SP-CAPs**|**Source**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |\-|Founders Edition|2|4|[TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/5.html)  [Gamers Nexus](https://youtu.be/OX9Eh_NaC5c?t=1105)| |Asus|TUF|6|0|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/TUF-RTX3080-10G-GAMING/gallery/)| |Asus|TUF OC|6|0|[TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-3080-tuf-gaming-oc/3.html)  [der8auer](https://youtu.be/kEnkUFNi9A4?t=191)| |Asus|Strix|6|0|[der8auer](https://youtu.be/8IDMS54jEFM?t=247)| |Asus|Strix OC|6|0|[Asus](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-RTX3080-O10G-GAMING/gallery/)| |Colorful|iGame Advanced OC|0|6|[JayzTwoCents](https://youtu.be/x6bUUEEe-X8?t=761) ^(1)| |EVGA|XC3 Black|1|5|[EVGA announcement](https://forums.evga.com/Message-about-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-SP-CAPs-m3095238.aspx)| |EVGA|XC3|1|5|[EVGA announcement](https://forums.evga.com/Message-about-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-SP-CAPs-m3095238.aspx)| |EVGA|XC3 Ultra|1|5|[EVGA announcement](https://forums.evga.com/Message-about-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-SP-CAPs-m3095238.aspx)| |EVGA|FTW3|2|4|[EVGA announcement](https://forums.evga.com/Message-about-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-SP-CAPs-m3095238.aspx)| |EVGA|FTW3 Ultra|2|4|[EVGA announcement](https://forums.evga.com/Message-about-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-3080-SP-CAPs-m3095238.aspx)   [/u/notsymmetrical](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/izhpvs/the_possible_reason_for_crashes_and_instabilities/g6keevs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)| |Gainward|Phoenix|1|5|[r/nvidia mod table](https://www.reddit.com/r/nv
2546,"I bought a manual car 5 months ago driving on the clutch that was never changed for 130k km. I got used to the consistent pressure from the clutch  but I got a new clutch in today and it feels really strange to me?    It almost feels like there's two ""sections"" of the clutch  first inch or so it's very light  but the return pressure(?) Just before the biting point is  a lot stronger? Is this normal? I stalled my car and the second/third shift is jerky because I can't keep it at the biting point before the pedal shoots back up. Basically dumping the clutch because I can't hold it   Is a new clutch supposed to make a car feel like a completely different car? My previous clutch is heavy af yet consistent  biting point at the top half inch."
2547,I loved this game when I played it over the summer and already got more than my money’s worth. The new stuff just looks insanely awesome  and the fact that it’s all free is crazy. More items to build around in SP sounds great  and I’d happily take it as an excuse to play the amazing story again. MP reminds me of Bioware’s multiplayer modes for mass effect and dragon age (which I enjoyed)  but without the exploitive mtx.   Very excited. This was the biggest surprise hit of 2020 for me by far  and it keeps on giving.
2548,Interesting. Back when I worked at Workhorse Electric Vehicles (on the project that eventually became Lordstown Motors' Endurance Pickup Truck) they were using an identical system. Even though its been dropped in newer versions of the Endurance truck  I'm surprised Ford was able to patent something that they've been doing at Workhorse for years. What's the novel part of this tech? Is it the disguise? Or is it the portability  how you can move it between trucks? Or is it a general patent on range extender tech in consumer pickups?
2549,I'm thinking we will see PHEV in segments they are currently super limited in  like Trucks and proper SUVs (frame on body  not that crossover stuff).    Or maybe we won't  because gas is currently  cheap where those types of vehicles are popular
2550,Your question has probably been answered by enough comments here. But don't let your degree limit which title you look for especially when it comes to internships. I got a DS internship with just my undergrad. If your up to the task then by all means do what your most interested in! Good luck out there.
2551,The next \#SmashBrosUltimate DLC fighter will be revealed tomorrow at 7am PT! The video presentation will be roughly 3 minutes long  followed by a brief message from Director Masahiro Sakurai.

2552,Heya guys! I'm a high-school teen that just popped my head into this strange new world you guys inhabit. I've been playing games for my whole life and in a fit of crazed inspiration after playing Undertale and Deltarune  I finally want to inch into this field. But as the starry-eyed spring chicken that I am  I have no prior experience in game development or any of its subsidiaries. No programming or coding skills (consisting of rudimentary HTML knowledge that I've entirely forgot and no option to take classes for the rest of they year where things stand now)  and as much as I love music and art  I can't compose music or play an instrument and I have no digital experience (with my traditional skills being what I'd call shoddy). Writing is great  but I can't seem to come up with any ideas that stand out. I have a few random strewn-out concepts  but I feel like they're too closely linked with DR/UT or just aren't really very good freestanding concepts. Basically  I'm inspired without ideas or experience. I would ask some friends but I'm not really sure how good managing a team would be at my level with the pool I'd have to choose from. I'm saving up right now but I probably won't have any sort of budget until January for anything  and that's if I put all I have into it  since I'm pretty much flat-broke where everything stands now. I just hope that I can commit myself to whatever I start (if I do end up starting anything) since keeping commitment and *staying determined* was always the final twist of the knife that's killed all of my projects in the past.  Sorry if I'm pouring my life out here  I don't normally post much  but any advice would be helpful! Really just trying to comb through without getting overwhelmed and crushing the fragile egg that is this new interest. Thanks!  Also: Any ideas for coming up with character  story  and world ideas? I want to know if anybody here has any good writing and design tips  as well as advice on how to stay creatively sated while working on other things (building experience and skill  in my case).
2553,Apparently MSI has updated their product pages  the 3080 Gaming Trio now shows 2 MLCCs like the FE  but only for the Spanish site [link](https://es.msi.com/Graphics-card/GeForce-RTX-3080-GAMING-X-TRIO-10G.html) (the pic is at the bottom). Maybe it was like this before but it seems a bit weird to use different pictures depending on the region.
2554,"The Legend of Zelda: Reach  On the last mission as Zelda  ""Objective: Survive""  It's gonna break my heart if  unlike normal games where you get more playable characters you progress  in this game you start with a whole roster of playable characters to choose from but they start dwindling as you progress."
2555,I recently saw the Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu Series (Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita) and the  anime (Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta) movies and I loved them. They are from 2016/2017 and I wanted to know if there is any news about a sequel or something similar. Thanks
2556,"This is definitely a decision to make. I am running an experimental campaign for 2 groups to flesh out ideas for my campaign world  because I have had trouble deciding on some aspects.  Various themes and ideas I currently have in the game:  West-Marches exploration: Hex map exploration of an unknown region of the main continent. Players seem to be enjoying it  but I am now out of prepared content for the entire zone.  The Weird - The moon broke open and lovecraftian horrors have been raining down from the sky. When this started 20 years ago it was a total apocalypse and the world has not recovered much. This started off strong but I have ran out of good ideas as to where to go with it.  Archaeology and History exploration - Players don't give a crap. Almost entirely scrapped. I was going to have them gather lore about the first gods to exist  some racial based lore on dragonborn   elves  and dwarves.  The Big Bad - I have an idea about a ""he who must not be named"" type of BBEG that some 500 years ago attempted to pull the world into the Shadowfell  part of a bargain with Dark Fey in exchange for power.   The First Gods - This is now becoming a storyline that uses scraps of dragonborn lore I am scrambling to rewrite  as well as general ""how everything was created"" history.   The Fey - I have something involving sorcery  the fey  and some dark fey  as well as Feywild vs Shadowfell going on. I have no idea at all where to go with this major plot line.  After a year of running these two campaigns  I'm coming to the conclusion I need to cut some stuff  as well as sit down and do a total overhaul.   I think I will scrap the West-Marches idea. I am finding I am not enjoying it as much as GM as I thought I would  although the players are.  I want to scrap the Weird. While the idea has promise  it requires more work than I want to do.   For the BBEG I described  keep. The villian himself is pretty boring though and I need inspiration to keep him from just being some clone of voldemort/sauron/etc. I also don't like how I have used the Fey so far. It is definitely between this or the Weird as the ""main big plot-line"".  TL:DR My experiment with a variety of ideas has led me to the conclusion that you should focus on only a single ""world event"" plot line. Other ideas/themes/mechanics should exist to support that. I'm now in a situation where I have too much to deal with as a GM  I am burnt out  and not enjoying working on my games when I have to scramble to develop all these ideas before every session.  I'd like to end both campaigns for a while so I can re-develop my setting  but of course nobody else will GM."
2557,I can ad lib anything and make it seem like it was planned. A good dose of filling in the blanks to explain cause and effect works wonders.   My players know that I do it regularly  but that I also have actual plans  so they never know which is which.
2558,"In my experience  one needs to experience drivers cars before they understand how much an experience can be worth.   I still remember my first time riding in a 2003 M3 ""racing"" to get a carry out pizza. Never looked at cars the same way again"
2559,I’m fine with the $70 price tag. Just  please don’t hold your content behind a paywall/Battle Pass/Season Pass/etc.          Edit: by “Season Pass”  I mean content that has no real substance to be placed behind a Season Pass.
2560,I recently had an idea to create a homebrew campaign setting that is heavily inspired by the history and mythology of Ancient China. However  I was wondering if there was already a campaign setting or gaming system already that already has a similar theme?
2561,I have seen many articles claiming that DS will eventually be part of a wider software engineering discipline and that Data Scientists should learn more about software engineering to prepare themselves for this shift.  I am now trying to learn more about software engineering  but still have very little idea where to start. Can anyone please suggest some good resources/topics to delve into?  Here is my list so far: 1. Learn more about algorithm/data structure 2. CI/CD tools like Jenkins 3. Docker and kubernetes 4. Some data engineering concepts such as databases and data pipelines (Apache Beam  Flink  Spark) 5. Cloud computing
2562,The didn’t need to buy ARM to use the ISA. Tegra has existed for years.  Never the less  they could make a “desktop” CPU but it would be very niche unless windows ARM takes off on tablet and laptop devices.   More likely they’ll replace Mali with GeForce in the reference cores and make a bigger data center solution push.
2563,At this point  employers expect you to have the coding skills.  Gone are the days of “i know math - hire me and train me!”.   It’s expected that you’ve trained yourself in the coding aspects of the job - other applicants have already trained themselves.
2564,These things fly off all the damn time here in Pennsylvania. People have the steepest driveways here  it's insane. Ask your mechanic if it's possible to zip tie it back on-- if it's still attached  they can just punch a little hole in it and zip tie it back up. It'll save you three hundred bucks.
2565,Some browsers based on Chromium can kill your connection when your tabs are in background or not in focus (i had this problem).  Solutions are : - Set a ping/pong exchange betweent client/server - Set a silent sound to avoid your connection to be killed (tabs emitting sound survive because they didn't want to kill this youtube feature lulz)  I hope my advices can help
2566,If it is anything like my Golf  there is an entire zip code between the ratios of 1st and 2nd. Once you get into 2nd  changing fast up the box is easy  but 1-2 is a nightmare.  Just looked - and the Jetta is even worse than the golf!
2567,Good evening Ari  first let me say thanks for your reviews on tom's hardware and techpowerup  they have helped a lot of people. I want to ask what would you buy if you wanted a good and reliable PSU for a high end system if you were limited to only the greek market (skroutz  eshop  plaisio)? I can find the Corsair RMx PSUs but is there anything cheaper that is as good and silent?
2568,Good call out! We use Prophet a bit at our company and have noticed similar effects on yearly seasonality projections.   If you don't mind me asking  how have you been handling the COVID effects? We've been exploring both coding it as a holiday effect and excluding datapoints as outliers entirely. Both seem to do a fair job of fixing the seasonality weirdness  but I was curious if you had any other approaches you have found to work well.
2569,Sticking to rom-coms  Kaguya-sama as mentioned many times is probably the best overall.  Wotakoi is slightly over 2 years (spring 2018) and probably is not as good as Kaguya-sama.  But I feel the characters are more believable which boosts it for me personally.   I won't say much on Takagi-san 2 because it's a sequel.  I'll only mention (in case you didn't watch the first season) that it's technically a short form anime if that's your jam.  Then Fruits Basket gets an honorable mention due to nostalgia.

2571,> The lesson to take away from this I guess is to kick problem players out immediately  especially if your the anxious type like me.  That is a pretty hard lesson  especially if the player is a good or close friend but the styles of playing dont mesh well. It is probably always better for all people involved to handle it that way.
2572,Heya folks  sorry to bother you guys! I've just been pulling my hair out for the past few hours since I can't fix 2 blue screens that I always get on my computer!

2573,Hey guys   I need some help from the community. I am about to run a new D&D campaign but I am stuck at what to run ..

2576,You can write AI that generates code snippets. But making an AI that produces literal code statement after statement? Thats some google ass shit right there. Because so far I only saw google do it and their child-AI beat every human-made AI by far. So unless you're very experienced idk if a simple codewriting AI would be possible since it'd take quite a bit of processing power
2577,I recommend something with action  potential dark themes to not be too childish  good songs  and some comedy thrown in to not be too dark (serious but not sadistic). I got my friend into anime using Bungou Stray Dogs.
2578,Doubling the power budget almost never doubles the performance. Laptops operate closer to optimal power efficiency so doubling the power budget gets approx 20-40% more performance on desktop. Actually looking at frequency (turbo not base!) can give you a very good estimate for same architecture with same core numbers.
2579,There’s waste in every industry. That’s the beauty of modern society though — the winners and innovators fund these endeavors that may or may not find successes of their own. There are plenty of studios funded by bigger parent companies that never profit.   Who knows  maybe they haven’t shipped anything not but they’ll make their own hit indie game when they’re 40.
2580,Prices are meh  tho not bad considering the pref upgrade is even better than zen 2. The non x parts will probably also come out at a discount when the early buyers absorb the first few batches.  I wish they told us if the IO die was 14 or 12 nm  or memory controller updates. I want to run duel rank 3800mhz memory.  Also  big navi is where it's expected to be. Just a tad slower than a 3080. Will be interesting to see the power targets and actual price tho.
2581,Just try to make her a realistic person with goals and flaws. Don’t make her stereotypical. If she’s mysterious  then start by crafting her past and decide what parts of her she wants to keep a mystery from others.   Also  maybe base her off of someone to get some ideas. Think of mysterious characters in fiction. A character that comes to mind is Damon Salvatore from TVD  who is morally gray and keeps his diabolical plans hidden. Another example is Katniss Everdeen from Hunger Games  who keeps to herself.  Hope that helps!
2582,Yes  you can buy a package. The overall diameter will be about the same as the wheel will be bigger but the tire sidewall will be smaller. (Since overall diameter is about the same the speedometer will also be about the same)  For example  the 15s are 195/65-15 and you're upgrading to OEM size 215/45-17. Both are about 25 inches total. Have them shipped to a nearby tire shop  they will install and align  and then sell your old ones on FB marketplace or something.  Best bang for the buck in that size are Vredestein Quattrac Pro if you want all seasons
2583,It must be so stressful to do PR at Tesla  waking up in the morning to 20 missed calls because the CEO you’re responsible for went on a drug binge and promised everyone the new Tesla Autopilot will be able to win the Indy500 or some dumb shit like that.  Elon must’ve fired the entire department after they tried to take away his phone again.
2584,All the issues you note can be easily remedied with some practice and learning. They’re really minor things that really don’t affect anyone who uses Python on a daily basis. The pandas issues you mentioned- you can use group_by  map  apply in python. There are really bad examples on stackoverflow if you ask bad questions sometimes. I’ve ran into that before  but after framing my questions better or differently  I found correct solutions. Nowadays  I just refer to the pandas documentation  which just makes every easy.   OOP is important  as classes are important in almost every other language as well. Python makes classes easier than almost every other OOP language too. When it comes to actually deploying code  putting models into production in a scalable way  making rest APIs  etc  python and its ability to do OOP and everything R can do as well makes everything easy to approach.   If your job doesn’t require that kind of stuff and what you mostly do is statistical analysis  then sure R is fine to use. However  I rarely ever see it being useful or used for production level environments. You can learn data science in R and do data science in R  fine. But when it comes to making data science truly useful for client facing applications  python wins. Additionally  all machine learning research happens with Python. If you want to use cutting edge models  you’ll need Python.   Learn both. There is no harm to it. I actually also came from BME. My first language was MATLAB. Then Python  and then R for one class- my first machine learning class. The professor historically used R  so we all learned the ropes. Out of all three languages  python was by far the most useful  especially for some advanced Bme classes like computational physiology. As a data scientist  I use Python for all ml development  and JS for front end (client facing products). I never need to use R  but if there is any other job in the future wants me to use R  I’ll be moderately ready.   Also  data science jobs are always requiring you to know a lot of languages and frameworks. More and more job posting are wanting full-stack capable data scientists  especially for higher paying roles. The vast majority of those roles require excellent knowledge of Python. I think these minor issues are worth adapting to and learning about in order to be ready for that if you’re going to ever change jobs. However  again  if you like R and want to pick roles that use R a lot  then that’s fine too.
2585,"A good 18 years ago  I asked the very same question you did  probably in the same period of time when I was doing digital logic design in university. So you know those ""advanced topics"" in your lecture notes that your lecturer probably tells you not to worry about them except maybe 3a because hinthint  it's in the next quiz? Well  all those are the easy parts/ basics in real world CPU design.  I'll try to shine a light on your question. Here goes:  You start with a high level abstraction language like VHDL  Verilog or Systemverilog to describe the various blocks in your design. Known as RTL (Register Transfer Language)  this is what the hardware designer code to realize functions like an adder  state machines  comparators  multiplexers  etc. Of course with the dominance of synchronous clocked design  this also means coding in the clocked storage elements known as flip flops and latches. You know those funky toggle flip flops and such they jam down your throat in school? Toss that aside. 99% of the time  it's a d-ff or d-latch. LOL. So yeah  you use the always\_ff or always@ blocks to describe those stuff in RTL  and each standalone file (preferably) consists of a module. That module can then be called over and over again  connecting the known interface ports to different signals at the upper level.  Once you have the RTL coded  there are several ways to get from there to layout mask. If you look at an advanced CPU like say  Intel Core CPU  you will find more than one ""design style"" used to build the circuitry. Structured high performance arithmetic circuit e.g. very wide and fast adder would require a designer to read the RTL and draw the schematic in schematic-entry software like Cadence Virtuoso. Then a layout designer translates the schematic by placing the logic gates' layout on the floorplan and wire them up. Ok  time to take a detour to talk about standard cells.  While it is entirely possible to create a CPU from transistors (yeah just a bunch of channels with gates strapped over them)  it is more efficient to build a layer of abstraction over individual transistors by stringing them together to form logic functions. So a team goes in and draws the layout of groups of transistors connected together to create AND/NAND/OR/DFF/DLAT functions and then make them into black boxes with the boundaries  internal blockages  and interface pins visible.  So back to design style. You know those L1/L2/L3 cache these companies will tout every new CPU? They are realized using SRAM and/or Register File circuits. These involves taking transistors to form bitcells which are then tiled to form bitslices then bitvectors  then banks  and of course there's the decoders  static latch  sense amp  and the stuff to form essentially a very compact structure for on-die memory.  Then there's also RTL2GDS/synthesis/APR where more and more blocks are turning to nowadays. Basically you run a synthesis tool like Synopsys Design Compiler/ Fusion Compiler/ Cadence Genus that"
2586,I argue against the idea that we had very different graphics in 2013.  Sure  they're *better*  but they're nowhere near the graphical and engine differences between a game from 1988 and 1995.   And that's not even taking in to account how games in the 80s and 90s were largely built entirely in-house  and games created now are collections of licensed engines  frameworks  libraries  and some in-house creations and modifications.    Using outside resources means you don't have to keep updating the core  you just update the frameworks you're using and verify what you're doing still works.  GPUs increase?  That's fine  swap a model out with a higher polygon version and upgrade the textures - done.  Month of work  not rebuilding the entire engine to take in to account that 3D acceleration is even possible as you would have needed to do in the mid 90s.  Not to mention that  if you already know your dev cycle is going to last 4 years - you aren't going to build for the average system today.  You're going to build for a cutting edge system  or maybe even something that'd make a cutting edge system beg for mercy because in 4 years it'll be standard to mediocre gaming specs.  And if you delay another two years  it'll be Office Computing specs.  And all that's assuming you don't find a fundamental flaw and have to start over along the way  which is possible.  If you draw up your gameplay loop  get a demo going  seems fine  get more of your systems in place and find it's a cluttered  confusing mess or worse yet  not fun  you have to start over.
2587,Hi everyone   &#x200B   I am building an internal A/B testing tool to automate hypothesis tests across various marketing channels. We use a Bayesian framework to run the tests. As part of the tool  I'm building out a reporting suite to visualize and explain test results in a standard way. That way  we as a data science team can quickly execute tests and visualize the outcomes in a way that is both consistent and clear to non-technical stakeholders.  &#x200B   I'm curious - for those of you who work in industry and regularly work with business stakeholders  and particularly those who use Bayesian estimation for your tests and especially if you feel your company has this pretty well figured out - how do you present A/B test results to your stakeholders? What visuals do you include  are they standardized  what metrics do you show  how are you explaining it?  &#x200B   Right now  I generate a three-pane plot with  1. the posteriors of the individual groups for the parameter being estimated in the same plot 2. the posterior of the difference in the parameter between the two groups to show magnitude of the difference and probability of positive difference 3. the posterior of the % lift in the parameter between the two groups to show relative increase/decrease of the parameter and probability of positive lift  I also am outputting a table with all the comparisons being made and relevant statistics such as HPD range and posterior point estimates in non-technical verbiage so it's always clear what's being presented.
2588,"> So my question is how to become very good gamedev in 3 years or less for example to be on Senior level.    Well  I don't know(and I think nobody really knows that)  how much time  does it take to be ""Senior"" level  but if you want to become better game dev  just make games. That's it. Of course start from small projects and then gradually increase scope(but not too much).  If you want to work at AAA company  I'd focus on area  where you want to work. If you want to  be a gameplay programmer  making games is a good idea. Maybe you want to be a tools programmer? Then learning how to make custom level editors/ workflow improvemenets tools for testers  designers  artist is a good idea."
2589,You need your masters to get through the resume stack at any US company with a solid reputation and many applicants. Or you can apply to 1. relatively unknown companies or 2. lower paying posts and make a bigger impression relative to the candidate pool. If you don’t have a Masters you should be ready to take less than 6 figures to get your foot in the door with a company in the US market.

2592,My recommendation: don't modify it until you've caught up on all the deferred maintenance. Modifying a car that is unsafe or unreliable is just plain stupid.  If you want to put aftermarket headlights in it  don't. They're total and complete shit.  If you want to put aftermarket tail lights in it  don't. They're total and complete shit.  If you want to lower it on eBay coilovers  don't. They're total and complete shit.

2593,Well for starters you're addressing 2 different kinds of hardware here. CPU has a alot of legacy instruction sets that it has to take into account vs GPU which can more readily accommodate new parts into the pipeline if they so choose (e.g. tensor cores).  A big part is fab process  suggest looking into EUV which is still in it's infancy and only came to be used in production a little over 2 years ago.  Another aspect that's being looked into is chip-on-chip i.e. the processor version of 3D VNAND.  On top of that you've got standard features that can be iterated on e.g. VRM   cooling design / TIM  memory bandwidth  etc.
2594,Like any estimation   You poll various segment (or find relevant public data) of the population and you extrapolate to the entire population.  You establish segment using logic (look at public data regarding number of mobile devs on other countries  mobiles penetrations on the population's market  etc - then extrapolate to your population) The most important is to explain/document your estimation   Polling/Data hypothesis  biais  why you did it that way.
2595,In your system tray  you have Steam  Epic Game Store  One Drive and Google Drive. Close them all and it should help. BTW these are usually set to run at start up and will certainly eat as much RAM as they can. They can all be disabled from the Start Up tab in Task Manager.
2596,I hear a lot of people say theory is important and of course  most people (including myself) would agree. But I'm curious how much theory is *enough* for most data science jobs that are not research science. I understand that for people who are doing scientific research  it's quite important and may even require a PhD in CS/stats. But I'm not talking about those data science jobs.  I'm talking primarily for the run of the mill data science jobs that are solving business problems. Is it important to know the major proofs and theorems? Is it important that I need to know advanced mathematical properties of regression models or convolutional networks  for instance? Should I be learning measure theory? How much theory is sufficient to be a good data scientist in a business setting?

2598,In marketing we call it uplift modeling. Academically it's called heterogeneous effects/conditional average treatment effects. Other commentators are calling this A/B testing  which is technically true  but colloquially I think most people associate A/B tests with marginal/population effects rather than individual effects.  &#x200B   A regular A/B test: Let's say that an individual's probability (`P`) of conversion (`C`) is denoted by `P(C)`. Our treatment status is denoted by `T` \- if `T=0` then we are talking about the control group  if `T=1` then we are talking about the test group. Then the probability of converting given that they received the control promotion (or no promotion  if that's your control) is `P(C|T=0)` and the probability of converting given that they received the treatment promotion is `P(C|T=1)`. The effect of the treatment then is `P(C|T=1) - P(C|T=0)` \- i.e.  how much does the conversion probability change if we show them the treatment vs. the control? When evaluating this in a traditional A/B test  we typically look at this for the *population* and apply the 'winner' to the whole *population -* so everyone gets the 'winning' promotion.  &#x200B   In an uplift/HE/CATE model  we again are estimating `P(C|T=0)` and `P(C|T=1)` \- however  we also take into account the *individual-level covariates* such as age  income  profession  etc. Therefore  we add new conditions to our probabilities: `P(C|T=t)` becomes `P(C|T=t X=x)` where `T=t` is the treatment status and `X=x` indicates that we are also conditioning on the individual's attributes. So you can say 'For a PhD holder aged 65 in rural Pennsylvania  giving this promotion increases their conversion probability by 10%' but also 'For a GED holder aged 24 in metropolitan New York  giving this promotion *decreases* their conversion probability by 10%'. For the former customer  you can then decide to show them the promotion (they are persuadable) and for the latter customer  you can decide to *not* show them the promotion (they are a 'sleeping dog' - let them lay).  &#x200B   Inferencing on which types of customer are more or less effected by the promotion can then be done as if it were any other type of model.  &#x200B   [here](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/video/How-uplift-modeling-helped-Obamas-campaign-and-can-aid-marketers) is a video discussing how the Obama campaign used uplift modeling to determine what kind of person/who they could persuade to vote for Obama vs. who they should leave alone/could not be persuaded and therefore were not worth the time or budget.  &#x200B   [Here](https://pylift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the documentation for Pylift  which is a python implementation of a certain kind of Uplift modeling approach that allows you to use any estimator regardless of bias estimates in the statistical sense.  &#x200B   Google search for Uplift modeling or Heterogeneous Effects modeling or Conditional Average Treatment Effects modeling for more
2599,I'm not an expert in this by any degree as I'm transitioning into the field from Academia so bear my thoughts with a grain of salt.   From what I can tell speaking with folks who are data scientists  the field has moved past the initial surge in interest and the admittedly lower bar to entry in the past. The requirements or expectations are getting higher for particular skillsets (e.g. ML) so I would be cautious about taking any advice read online to heart - or at least  consider when it was written. It's a fast moving field and things have changed quite a bit since that early Forbes article saying it was the hot new thing.   I agree that a lot of job listings require a BS  even a PhD in some cases  and often years of experience. That said  I'm not sure that means you don't have a chance  though I suspect it will limit the number of positions you'll be considered for. I know a lot of HR departments will automatically scan your resume for keywords and text and they may reject you on autopilot if they don't find the right educational keywords.   I also have been told to not discount experience  especially if it's data science related with clear outcomes. However  from what you've said so far  it doesn't sound like you have significant enough experience to overcome the educational background hurdle - those projects and datasets will not be seen as anything more than elementary because they have been widely publicized with step by step tutorials. They're fine for learning  but they're also examples that anyone can do and are basically worthless to even put on your resume - so I've been told at least.   I think part of the issue of transitioning into data science from a fully self-taught background is that the nature of the field inherently draws from multiple fields  often with years of educational background providing a base. I'm not saying it's impossible  but I suspect it would be pretty difficult since you're basically trying to make up for an equivalent background in half the time or less. It just doesn't seem realistic to me for where you're currently at - at least for getting a position with the title data scientist.   So  I guess the two main options that I see would be to either go back to school and get a bachelor's degree in something related to data science OR while you continue to work on your background and/or general experience with doing data science related projects  try to find an entry level data analyst position and work your way up from there. Getting some unique and insightful projects will be key to getting a position if you go this route. That said  I do feel that even a data analyst position will not necessarily be easy to get - it also generally requires a degree and background knowledge that in my experience  takes years to acquire. I don't want to discourage you if this is what you're interested in  but I think it's important to realize that it's going to take a heck of a lot of work to get up to speed.   I think what you'
2600,I've been thinking of making a city builder game (haha  original  I know). I've looked into how tile games are handled in JavaScript  but I am not sure if that is the right route to go. I know I could choose any route and make it work  but is there a proper way to make a tile based game? Could anyone point me in the right direction to learn how tile games work? Is a tile based city builder even the right way to make a game of that style? TIA!

2604,What are your thoughts on challenging each other to solve a problem? I used to work for an executive who likes people to challenge each other  even if it’s people within the same team. My thoughts on this is  when there is a problem to be solved at work  there are 2 ways to find a solution  one is to challenge each other until a solution is found  and two to work together until a solution is found. Would you hire someone who has a sense of challenging others or someone who has a sense of working together to solve a problem? Would be interested what others think about this too.

2606,Oof  it's been a while so an anime has left me so uneasy. Odin scares me a lot  especially with her apocalypse warning. I expected the anime to maybe have her claim to be a god but not actually prove it  yet all that happened made her perhaps support her claims.   It could still be that she saw the weather forecast  the traffic accident  that she knew Izanami  or the pitcher's tendencies. It still scares me.
2607,Most of these solutions (that I know of) automate the model building part of data science.  That's the least important part.  The hard parts of data science are the parts that come before or after.  The before part involves figuring out how the business works  what data we have  what problems we have  and how to solve them.  Then you have the modeling part.  Then you have the after part  where things need to be put into production and maintained.  Data scientists usually shine in the before or after part.  Click button  build awesome model isn't really that valuable.
2608,Would you recommend using this for true missing values where data is only available for a certain subset /group in the data? I have been either treating those as 0 or train a separate model for that single group.
2609,I would recommend to start off with the following:  \- Try [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD  \- Deploy your model on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)  it's free (at least your first app) and it's easy to get started with. Having said this  I recommend that you familiarize yourself with one of the major cloud providers later.  \- For serving  there are several options like [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/)  [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)  but my preferred option is to just use a generic REST framework like [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion). Note that connexion is a wrapper around Flask and it offers handy advantages over using Flask directly (which several people here have recommended).  This should be easy to setup and it won't cost you anything. You also mentioned docker  I recommend that you use that too and deploy a docker image to Heroku.  As for Airflow  I'd leave it out for now and perhaps try to learn it on its own without worrying about any models to begin with. Airflow has several components like executor  server  scheduler  database and it is usually deployed on Kubernetes (although you'll probably want to start with docker-compose) so it's definitely a tool I would recommend getting acquainted with but as a separate step from model deployment.  Optionally you could try a tool like [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) or [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) for pipeline orchestration  but I'd say these tools might not fit everyone's style and use case.  As a bonus  once you've done that  you could also deploy your model via [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (or Azure/GCP equivalent) which is also very useful to know.  Hope it helps  but I understand it may also sound overwhelming :)
2610,The show overall was nothing but cliche after cliche. From its very premise  OP protag goes to demon school  to the world and characters itself.  It's just that it felt so self-aware at times that had some really good moments if you are a power fantasy trash boy like myself. But I never had big expectations from the show  nor I did consider it good at any point. I'm really surprised that people did.
2611,There is ***Neon City Overdrive***...  [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2577/Peril-Planet/subcategory/36009/Neon-City-Overdrive](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2577/Peril-Planet/subcategory/36009/Neon-City-Overdrive)
2612,I don't generate names for everyone  and my party inevitably ends up talking to someone named Bob who I thought was a completely irrelevant shopkeeper. Otherwise I'm reasonably good about prep. What I'm NOT good about it summarizing after the session. I usually ask my players to do it  because it's more fun to get their skewed perspective on what happened. Of course  they don't always have time  so we end up not remembering some important details.  I can't manage multiple combats per session which ends up providing poor challenges for the player's combat abilities. I tend to focus on storytelling.  I don't always communicate the overarching problem or Big Bad for the campaign early  preferring a slightly more organic reveal. But this sometimes misses and doesn't provide sufficient motivation for the players.
2613,The last part: why do big corps like Microsoft  Samsung  Google and apple accept that shit or create it. Bluetooth works nowdays why can't you make USB good? Why are companies like Nintendo able to use an USBC connector but not be compatible with most usbc chargers? USB is a big deal and very important and its too important to leave to an organization that cant do proper naming  documentation or certification process.
2614,Things are tough for grads now because the market has slowed. What you would have been able to get 1 year ago are being filled by people who have been made redundant from other firms and who have more experience than you.  Companies want people who can hit the ground running especially if we are all WFH and have no one to supervise and onboard people IRL. So they're less willing to take a chance.  In my opinion  I wouldn't stress too much. I would continue working on projects and continuing to study whilst keeping an eye on the market but not getting too sucked into it. If you need to  consider engineering or data analyst or data engineering roles as these are usually more needs-based than like data science which is more of a risky R&D.
2615,My recommendation is to make the game in javascript as a web page  and have it interact with a python server.  but games like that are garbage because they have too many inherent showstopping issues.  Players who get in early get too much of an advantage and the economy inflates into meaningless numbers real quick  it's impossible to balance.
2616,Its all about timing right now.  HBM launched at the tail-end of GDDR5  offering superior price/performance on high-end memory bandwidth back then.  GDDR6 and GDDR6x however changed the prices: all of a sudden GDDR6 and 6x were a lot faster for similar costs. So it makes more sense to use GDDR6 now.  HBM2e is the latest HBM advancement and only most recently entered production. If HBM2e is cost effective  we'll surely see HBM2e designs within a year.  If they're not cost effective  then HBMNext is looking like 2022 or so.
2617,I’m a Software Developer and I think crunch time is pretty normal. In every project I worked with was at some point a crunch phase.  Even if you delay the release again it will have a crunch phase. There is always something to do.  It’s only important that we have  paid overtime  either way in money or time. But I know companies that illegally let worker work more for free.
2618,"My step-dad bought a manual Ferrari 360 recently and I was a little disappointed that he didn't get a F430 (what he was originally looking into buying). I always thought the 360 was kinda ugly and the ""poor man's Ferrari"". I have a mustang so I thought ""meh  my car has more power  it's not that exciting"" but boy was I wrong. Driving it the sound was amazing  it felt faster than my car and the gated manual felt so unique. I actually kind of regret driving it since I can't afford one for myself. Originally I was trying to convince him to buy a 458  but with it's lack of manual and my experience now I totally understand why he chose what he did."
2619,"I've always never given a shit about expensive cars  especially exotics. They were cool  I guess  but they're expensive and unreliable blah blah blah.  Yesterday  me and my friends spent the day driving in my friend's dad's 2013 Ferrari California.  And holy shit  I understand why people buy exotics. The interior was great  although I was in the front seat. The car sounded phenomenal  of course.  And god damn was it fast. While it made ""only 500+ horsepower""  it felt FAST. Like pinned to the seat doing a buck sixty fast.   So yeah  rant over  I now look at cars completely different."
2620,The biggest every day difference you will get is when take a highway exit after a rain  and half your car slides on water when the other half has grip. AWS  fwd  rwd  all behave differently.  On dry surfaces  you might feel if the road had a ton of imperfections/bumps all over  you kind of feel when the tire grips something and when it doesn't.   And you don't have to really push the car to it's limits to feel the difference  but in the same time  it might not make the biggest difference to most people.
2621,I mean  laptops can run so hot they burn your legs and still be fine so I see no issue here  I assume it only gets loud when it's at a 'critical temp'  I'm not exactly sure what that temp might be but if it never gets *that* hot then it should be fine
2622,Question: I was wondering if you've ever done a project where the person you're working with doesn't follow appropriate methodology for a particular type of analysis or just basic statistical things. If so  what did you do?  Background: I was working on a project recently that employed complex survey analysis. It was delegated to us by another company. I was assigned to it under this DS who is further up in the company. As we started working on the project  I've mentioned multiple times that I've done a very similar analysis before on this data because they said they've never done it before. My experience seemed to be ignored because when we spoke to the other company  they were requesting all sorts of odd things that totally goes against appropriate CSA methodology for what they want to do with it. After that meeting I've brought it up to that project supervisor (re: the upper level DS) that the methodology is inappropriate. But they insisted to just do it how they requested.   This is my first time dealing with something like this and not sure what else could have been done. I felt uncomfortable attaching my name to this project.
2623,"Pitchford is a known doofus  I wouldn't take anything he says too seriously.   However this upcoming gen is a pretty substantial jump in console hardware and games across the board are going to be taken to a whole new level. 95% of PC games over the past decade have been hamstrung in scope and interactivity just because the consoles have had absolute dogshit CPUs. PC gaming has largely been ""same games but higher framerates at higher resolutions plus sometimes mods"" for a long time. The new consoles aren't going to change that but the possible complexity and density of games is going to take a massive leap forward."
2624,The [Network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). It's very easy to find people who want to play D&D  if you have a desire to play D&D. There are tons of resources for it and almost every tabletop gamer probably cut their teeth on it.  This is a huge advantage  one that's far larger than the advantage provided by having a game that is objectively better. Even if you have a game that's D&D but better  It won't really make that big of a difference if you can't find people to play it.
2625,Hello everyone  I have this anime (or probably animated film) that I watched when I was young that I can’t remember. Hope you can help me remember the name.  “So  the only thing that I remember is this robotic angel (or with mechanic wings I suppose) that had a purple eye  like an orb  and was fighting against someone. If I’m not wrong  I remember he (or probably she) fall at some point.”  Unfortunately I can’t remember other detail  but I can say that I was never interested in this kind of stuff before  so I’m pretty new to this genre.  One thing that remind me a lot this scene was Megaman X8 video clips (with the purple girl)  however  I’m pretty sure it was an old CD that my mother bought for me when I was young.  We are talking about at least 15 years ago  probably more  around 15-20 years ago  Thank you everyone for your help   I appreciate your comment

2627,If you want a high fantasy setting with lots of guidance for adjudicating player actions  try Dungeon Fantasy RPG. It's got rules for things like using the Propaganda skill to advertise your party's services  using Counterfeiting to debase currency to make your coins go farther  or Cartography to make maps of your journeys to sell in town. And since it's based on GURPS  you can create plenty of crazy custom races and classes.
2628,Art is expensive. I worked in mobile games for a bit. An item that sold for XXX gems was literally just a piece of fancy art with some numbers attached to it. Artists were making similar to engineers  maybe 85% of on average.   If the tools you've tried so far aren't working well  you either have to spend a long time learning how to draw/render/etc (I don't recommend unless you are really into this)  hire someone  or use only free assets available online.  There's no easy way around.
2629,Not defending crunch  it’s shit and can be an indication of poor management. However I will say that the folks over at resetera absolutely have an ideological problem with CDprojektred.   It’s insane how many people there hate them with a passion and will openly celebrate when something negative comes out in games news media. Whether it’s crunch or some Dev has said something slightly politically incorrect on Twitter. Accusations of Nazism are thrown around willynilly and users who take exception are banned for “brigading” or “downplaying racsim/sexism/transphobia”.  Many people in games news media have accounts on that platform as well so this statement isn’t such a stretch.
2630,Not be content with mediocre projects but actually build and research something meaningful. There are so many up to date and live data out there  I still feel like an idiot for not having original content by the time I graduated.
2631,It’s worth a try.  I say do it.  The fact that you are concerned about how good of a manager you would be is a good thing.  A bad manager thinks they were born awesome and they don’t listen for anyone’s opinion.    Read some books or do some online training.  There is a lot to learn about people management.    For specialties like data science and analytics then good decision making is really important and that may be why you were asked to consider this role. Sometimes you have to listen to everyone.  More often you need to know the way forward and need to direct people accordingly.
2632,  [How to organize EDA data science scripts for final documentation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j5i92z/how_to_organize_eda_data_science_scripts_for/)   For  every EDA data manipulation step  I tend to have some verification  (almost like unit tests) to make sure the manipulation has been done  correctly and also to document my decision making if I am choosing which  parameter to use   As I am finalizing the project  I want to ensure  reproducibility and readability (for others and the future me). To this  end  I am not sure if the final scripts should continue to contain these  verification steps because they tend to  1. cluster the file 2. make it harder to re-read the code 3. make it slower to re-generate the results if input file changes  Will  really appreciate if you can share your solutions for finalizing and  documenting projects. It will be a bonus if it can be easily turned to  presentable materials (like a bookdown report). Thanks a lot!
2633,"Japan can do whatever they want in terms of what they choose to animate  but it's only really an anime if Japan chooses to animate it  so if a western studio tried to reboot one of those shows with an ""anime style"" it's still not really anime."
2634,I have a challenge for you make a game social media or messaging app that's compatible with iOS 2 - iOS 14  Rules 1. You're allowed to make 2 versions of the app one for iOS 2-iOS 8 and one for iOS 9and above. 2. It must be put on the apple App Store as a downloadable app (no jail breaking )
2635,These days  I just prep situations and NPCs who have their own agendas  so basically the first act of a conflict. Then I come up with some “Bangs”  things that might happen to shake up the situation.  Then I start play  put the players in a starting position where they need to act (not thinking about what they should do  that’s their problem  just that they’ll need to do something)  and then play the npcs. Pull out a Bang if things slow down. See where it goes.  It’s not “no prep”  but it’s prep that will be useful no matter what the PCs do. Much less stress  I’m really happy with it. If I don’t know where it’s going to end  I no longer have to do any work to “make” the PCs end up in the right place.
2636,*Talentless Nana* not even making it on to the list is a damn disgrace  people seriously need to finish that first episode instead of dropping it halfway.   *Akudama Drive* also had an incredibly strong first episode and should totally be higher  hopefully by the end of the season it'll be top 5. *Noblesse* was also pretty good but looks like GOH is gonna really drag it down  also make sure to watch the OVA Awakening first. *Moriarity The Patriot* is also looking pretty good  this season is shaping up to be 2020's best yet.     I think the top 3 will stay relatively the same with maybe *Haikyuu* and JJK fighting it out for #1 and maybe Higurashi beating *Tonikaku Kawaii* here and there.

2639,"This comment may get buried here  but I've been managing DS teams for some time  and my advice is simply this:  Being a good individual contributor/Data Scientist has little to no bearing on if you will be a good manager/leader.   In fact  if your team grows enough  most of your time wont be spent doing data science  it will be strategizing  communicating to key stakeholders  and coaching the individuals below you. Doing all of that leaves very little room for doing Data Science.  I think a good question to ask yourself to see if you're ready  is simply 'what does success look like in this role' - if you answer in an altruistic way (i.e. ""I want to see my analysts be successful and grow/develop in their career"") then you're probably 'ready'."

2641,Hey  I'm having a bug that I could not find any answer to it over reddit or on a google search.  Whenever I host a game from a lobby - my controlled pawn can move with WASD input  and everything is working fine - the Character Blueprint is working.  But when I join a session - the Character is possessed  but I can't move it. Same on client and server.  When I load the lobby map  without the main menu level  all of the players get pawn and can control it. The bug appears only whenever I use the JOIN SESSION.

2643,Well  first of all  you don't have to finish all those shows asap. It's not like you have a deadline at the end of the month. Some things you'll not even complete by next year  and that's fine.  But if you really want to cut down your list  I'd just look at what appeals to you the most out of it  and prioritise those. You might find that some of the other shows wouldn't be your thing  and you don't have to watch them after all.
2644,With such poor performance over the 3080  I still fail to see how Nvidia can squeeze a 3080 ti/20gb in. Anything less than like $1000 will kill the 3090. And do gamers really want 20gb of ram for 50% more price?  It's such a weird product stack.
2645,I don't mind it if their game actually answers the question  but there are plenty of people who are here trying to push their games all the time and it's in violation of the rules. You get to do it once a week and no more. Anyone I see pushing their own product can guarantee I will never buy it. If they can't respect the subreddit  I can't respect them.
2646,I watched the 2 seasons and movie of the original **Love Live!** The best way I can describe this series is that it's incredibly earnest. It has lots of incredibly cheesy moments  but it showcases them with a genuine passion that made me smile along.  I also watched **Toradora's ova**. The synopsis didn't interest me which is why I'd never tried it  but it was far better than I expected. It was great to be reunited with the characters again and I thought the humor was great.  There was also the **Nijiiro Days ova**. It was fun  but there's not much to say about it.
2647,I took both a SAS course and R course during my PhD. The majority of my work in industry is in Python but one day I was handed a project from a data scientist that left the company that was done in SAS. I can't tell you how grateful I was that I had some fundamental understanding of SAS and how to read the code.   This field gets caught up in all the fancy cutting edge work which may only be happening in a small section of industry or teams. Not everything is python and spark and cloud computing out in the real world. Projects were built in SAS  they still run in SAS  and it won't hurt to understand.   Besides you're going to learn Statistical programming in a statistical programming tool. Guess what you can apply in Python or R after knowing how it works in another language or tool. Statistical programming.
2648,So far  this is looking like it will become my favorite Love Live to date. The characters seem so much more alive and realistic  and the comedy is just on point. I'm really looking forward to the continuation!

2650,"I'd say Python is closer to the status quo in programming language design.  That means things you learn writing code typically translates well to python.  R is a bit of a niche language and as such it's not as ""pickup-and-play""-y.  Also both of them have pretty relaxed treatment of variable scopes. But it's less of a problem with python since it lends itself well to object oriented code."
2651,i mean in unsynched transmissions from the 60's shifting without using the clutch just meant you were good at it. You still *can* do it in modern transmissions  but its very hard and not needed.   The only damage would be a little bit of gear grinding and doing it once wont hurt anything. Especially at low speeds.
2652,The biggest car meet in my area is the so called Woerthersee Treffen...its located in Austria and people all over Europe come to visit it. There are many VWs  Audis and other german cars...but also many jdm and american muscle cars. I just love the atmosphere around the lake where the meet is. The meet takes about one to two weeks and people sit next to the street just to see cars rolling by. So i would like to read similar storys!  Sorry for my bad english guys...
2653,Back when G+ was the place for noodling about RPGs  I pitched an idea I wish would have picked up more traction. The premise was a 24-hour game that moved around the (real) world.   You’d divide the world into equal “slots” in which a game started in London  went on with one group of players for a few hours  then got passed on to the next group in the next “slot”. There would be either eight slots of three hours each  or six slots of four hours each.  I had the locations roughly figured out  and some ideas about how the game would be passed around. Post is lost to history  though.  In theory  once the game got back to London  you could have a different group give it a go  and keep going  creating a “sun never sets” sort of thing.
2654,"That's just basic threat assessment. I would give him the option of re-rolling and learning from the experience or invite him to leave. I he massively fucked up and was like ""no  this is the GM's fault even though I made a poor decision"" then he's probably the type of person to blame his failures on others in general. Either way  props for standing up for yourself and hopefully you can remove him from your group and have fun without him."
2655,The hero system works a bit like this.You determine the starting power level of the campaign by deciding the total points the character starts of with.Those points then get spent on attributes skills powers etc.So you can pretty much craft whatever you want.
2656,Some context: I started reading car magazines as a kid in 1989. The next few years were Peak Japan: MX-5  RX-7  GTR  Z32 300ZX  NSX  Type R  LS400  WRX  Evo  Supra  GT-Four. Europe was doing nothing interesting and American cars didn’t exist where I live  so my impression then was that Japan made the best cars in the world.  But if I’d become interested in cars in 2000 or 2010  I might have held a different view - most new Japanese cars around then were pretty boring and many of the legends I mentioned earlier were gone or fading away.  I also notice that many younger drivers I see who modify their cars have things like the Golf GTI. VW was barely selling cars where I live in the 90s.  So it occurred to me that my high regard for Japanese cars is the product of my interest taking off at a particular point in time  and we may never see the 90s JDM glory days again.  I’d be interested to hear from enthusiasts in say their teens and twenties. Is it me  or are the kids wrong? :)
2657,Often times data science is more than data science and you need to use other software dev tools. I find that linux is just easier to use when it comes to this and the terminal is really helpful tool. I
2658,"The back is sexy... But that fin is just godawful. It might have worked if it was smaller but that's all you see when you look at the car...  I believe that rearend is from an f-type  unsure of the front. Looks a bit like a C7 Corvette frontally (I would have gone with round headlights like porsche to emulate the alfa romeo they intended to celebrate)... Front is too generic and ""busy"" with all the extra inlet holes and hood jazz imo."
2659,Id say a good mouse with on the fly DPi switching like my G903 (Logitech) Its perfect for games but even better for those who like to snipe (hold a side button for lowering the DPI so you can snipe more accurately)   Or  for design like mouse drawing  or 3D stuff you want the different DPi as well.  If youre just a casual gamer  dont really do drawing or designing  dont care to drop the DPi for sniper games and all you do is youtube and type stuff. get a keyboard with a solid palm rest and mechanical keys. theyre quiet  can last over a million key hits and the G910 i have has programmable hot keys and can light up for darker environments.

2661,So those silver and gold pearls in the twin's eyes (which I thought were white and gold) have me thinking.  We haven't seen Sango and Miroku's twin girls in any of the promos but we did learn from the first episode that their names are Silver and Gold in Japanese.  I know they're Sesshomaru's kids but it's such a weird coincidence.  I wonder if that will come into play at any point.  Also  The Tree of Ages was like wow it's been tens years since these pearls have been near me.  I bet he yeeted the entire gang into separate eras.
2662,Low Fantasy Gaming is my favorite TTRPG. You can get a free PDF version from their [website](https://lowfantasygaming.com/freepdf/)  and I just recently finished coding the system for FoundryVTT (find it [here](https://gitlab.com/code382/lfg)). It can take a small amount of getting used to after coming from DND  as it’s a roll-under system for nearly everything except to-hit  but my players took to it fast. Magic is dangerous  combat can get intense  and Luck is a valuable resource that easily gets spent over time. Even better  players can really add their own spin on characters as every third level is defined by a “Unique Feature” that players can create on their own with GM approval (there are also a number of pre-made Unique Features provided in the paid version and through home brew linked on the site). The community is super cool and the creator encourages involvement and is very active in the Discord.
2663,$50 dollar price hike across the board is ridiculous for the low end  it makes sense for the high-end but having the same increase over much cheaper parts is very stupid  also only the R5 gets a cooler so thats another increase to buy one and add to that the prices 3rd gen has been going for and you will see that the price hike is too much. just my two cents dont flame me.
2664,"I like to focus on the decision making. ""You step on a tile and hear a CLICK noise. What do you do?"" or ""You notice there are wires stretched across this room. What do you do?"" The fun doesn't end just becasue they find a trap  either. If they find a trap they have to decide how to disarm it  or get past it.  I carry this mentality to the trap results  too.  ""A chute in the celing opens and starts pouring water into the room. What do you do?"" instead of just telling them they get hit in the face with an arrow for 2d8+2 damage.  Delayed effects are really awesome. A poison dart strikes Grog's arm. At first it just itches. But then after the first rest  he starts noticing that an inch or two of his flesh is turning stone!  Then the players have to decide how to cure it... or have to double-time it before Grog's arm (and maybe his whole body?) turns to stone. Sometimes  the outcome of a trap can lead to a whole mini-adventure.  My approach is fun  but it's not perfect. If you're running a system where the players can spend a spell slot and cure any and all poison  you may have to do some finagling so nobody feels cheated."
2665,"I am ML/AI  not so much DS but after years of coding rather boring applications as a dev  I took ""image processing"" at university (15 years ago so names were not thst fancy) in my first Semester.  Tbh I thought we'll be doing photoshop or so  ) but then it was all about filters  covariance matrices  differentials etc. and that was the first time that math suddenly made sense. And I saw there's more than writing CRUD software (actually I did embedded systems but also became boring at that point).  So then I took ML  signal processing  neuron models  medical computer vision  couple AI courses  medical statistics  biometrics etc.  Problem is that 15 years later I wonder if I'm actually  a better software engineer than math person :)."
2666,What do you expect? Samsung 8nm is more like an tweaked 10nm  which in turn is not that far off 12nm FFN from TSMC. The only thing that 8nm Samsung allowed nvidia to do was to massively increase the number of transistors. But they did it at a fairly high power consumption.
2667,Heya    I really want to make a prototype for a battle system I am developing. But I don't want to waste time in coding it all into Unity  if I do that I'm scared of having to rewrite everything as I'm not as good as programming right now as I'd like to be if that makes sense. I was juggling the idea of making it into a sort of card game format but that won't work because I'm going to need to test it with other people IRL. Rn with Rona I can't really try that haha.  So I've come on reddit to ask around if there's any software/tools out there that can help me either make these prototypes  or any ideas as to how I should go about the prototyping process?  Thanks!  Playwright.
2668,I actually think Activision should be recognized for what they did. These guys had to know that putting that clip in the trailer would cause a stir from China. It's a mini-middle finger to them because millions of people still see it  even if it has to be taken down eventually.
2669,"I've found that so many animes that people recommend to me are like ""I'm a *teenager* with *special powers* and I'm discovering a whole new world and getting *stronger* everyday."" Like come on  I could name probably ten off the top of my head that are all exactly like that. Is there anything you guys would recommend that has a genuinely unique plot and concept with few/no filler episodes? I like dark stuff too.  Thanks very much :)"
2670,Actually -- from the perspective of the characters -- the ending of Angel Beats is ultimately joyful (even if intermingled with some nostalgia and regret).  Perhaps  having seen Wandafaru raifu (After LIfe) and Haibane Renmei years before this prepared me for (properly) balancing the joy with the sadness.  -)
2671,Well it will probably be the best selling game for ever and ever ever.It has been around since the beginning and was the first one to reach mega popularity.Due to that it has decades of nostalgia behind it as well.It would be extremely difficult for it to lose the “best selling of all time” claim.It would have to go on the decline or be discontinued for decades and then have another popular game sustain a great amount of success for the same amount of time.
2672,VOLUNTEER DATA ANALYTICS FOR CHARITIES/NGOS ?  I'm a recent physics graduate who's currently applying to data  science masters. I've not managed to get any internships during my  degree or for the gap year I'm on right now but I've heard that doing  volunteer analytics for charities and NGOs might be an option. Can anyone recommend programs or volunteer schemes that might be worth looking into? I'm aware of Data for Democracy but am based in Europe so  if there are similar initiatives on this side of the Atlantic I'd be  very interested in hearing about them.
2673,Hi! Next wednesday i will be having my first interview for a data analyst job in a AI company (i was working as finance manager for 7 years  working with data  python  sql and R  but not as my only task).  I was told that the interview is going to last like 1:30 hours and i could evacuate all my tech specific doubts  the thing is  i dont really know what to ask because as i said  i dont know how big teams works in this area. To make it worse  i checked my interviewers profile on linkedin and has an MIT master degree on CS so im fairly intimidated.   What kind of questions would you ask in my place to my future boss? what kind of questions would you be expecting to be asked as a candidate?    Thanks in advance :)
2674,Personally I'm all for competition  the less of a monopoly one company has the better it works out for us. I mean  we're getting free games. However the one problem I do have with Epic is that rather than offer a better service they're just throwing money at the situation. Buying exclusivity to games just before they release is a great tactic but it is also a slimy one in my book. Either way  wait for sales.
2675,"I actually just had my game released on Steam yeaterday  so the difficulties are very fresh in my mind. Here's what you need to know:  1: If you've never released a game on Steam before it will take about 6 weeks for the process to be finished. The initial account set up takes about 4 weeks and your game has to be in the review process/""coming soon"" for 2 weeks. So plan for 6 weeks between finishing your page/game and people being able to buy it. If you've released before it gets cut down to more like 2 weeks (the initial 4 weeks is just for initial setup like bank accounts and stuff) Oh and your store + game have to go through a review process. If you fail the process  that 2 week timer resets. And they can fail you for some really minor stuff.  2: Start working on your steam page early. You don't have to get it all done in 1 day. If you want a really good looking store its going to take a lot of work. That 4 week period I was talking about above  be spending that time getting the store front together.  3: You need way more pictures than you think you will. Minimum of 5 screen shots  and around 8 - 10 other images used for store page stuff. You need a different picture for small page lists  large page lists  popup window pics. Tons of pictures. So take a ton of screenshots and be ready to make some templates.  4: Putting your game files on steam is not as easy as dragging and dropping your files into a website. You have to manually setup SteamCMD (a free small program) and run it like dos. The tutorial videos on it are helpful enough  though could use with more videos that explain more stuff. Its pretty easy to work with but if you have any trouble it can be hard to get help right away. Plan some time for this. All day. It doesn't take a whole day  should take maybe 30 min  but plan for a whole day just in case.  5: It costs $100 to put a game up on Steam. You pay $100 when you set up your Steam Direct account which gives you one ""free"" upload to Steam. (Note: they do NOT charge you multiple times if you fail the review process  only when you get to the end and gully publish the game)   So with all of that  its not so much that the process is difficult  it is just way more difficult than you think its going to be. And takes far longer than you think it is going to take. I still say it is worth it  if nothing else than for the personal achievement (which is why I did it) but knowing that it is a bit more involved than putting a game on itch.io should be something to know going in.  If you have questions you can always message me  though I can't garuntee I'll have great answers haha"
2676,For that price you're not going to get a high performance PC  but see if you can find a Ryzen 3200G based system. It does a little bit of everything reasonably well. It's got four cores and integrated graphics that should let you play most games at 1080p.
2677,Well  hard to expect a Sony guy praising MS or otherwise.  The half-gen like S is good for MS. Good for casual gamers.  But bad for core gamers. For developers... hard to say. Some will suffer  some will benefit  cause one will struggle with preparation of a second game version and other will be glad to have substantial install base earlier.
2678,**First Timer**  * Eh  so it turns out Elchi was testing Jiron  * Lol those guys just falling down the stairs after climbing since they were tired or injured badly  * Carring being a greedy bastard at the thought of giving a reward of 3000 gallant for getting back Xaungle [](#miyamoriunimpressed)  * Horla isn’t any better by telling everyone else the reward is 2000 gallant lol  * Cowboy man has his own walker machine called Vickman  * So Rag and Blume have come back to spy and take the other Xabungle but get caught by Elchi  * Ohh so she actually wants to help them. It’s really hard to figure out what Elchi wants to do yet. She supports but still does not support Jiron and the others.  * The bodyguards name is Fatman lol. Why keep such a name  * Somehow Jiron and Chill got Xabungle to work. And Daiku helps out as backup  * So Rag and Blume come back. Elchi stays back to watch the show  * Hmm so is the logic here that if someone has the walker machine for 3 days after being bought/stolen it is theirs. * The Breakers have kidnapped Chill [](#holdback)  * Oooh Elchi backed up Jiron after the kidnap stuff.

So far he’s not that impressive and just stealing like the others and observing generally  2) Hmm the Innocent are the ones who are helping out the others on Zola including with the robots and due to that maybe are kept on some higher status. They could be people from another planet maybe who have settled here and were not involved with how the planet is now a wasteland. It will not be a surprise that they are actually bad and are some sort of rich people and not actually that innocent
2679,Executive cars are more expensive underneath to build. They use more expensive materials  better Chassis  better engines  etc. In order to keep the price reasonable they have to cut out some of that stuff. The 3 Series might seem underequipped at first glance but it will out handle  accelerate  brake and probably be just as fuel efficient.
2680,I hope SE can see how much we don't give AF about this announcement on face value.  Right now (rightfully so) people feel this game will come out in +5 years after this announcement and will not be anything close to what the released product looks like. Ultimately  a waste of time in my opinion.   Stop showing stuff when you are not ready!!!

2683,Have a few friends who are doing this. It’s decent. Depends on what you want to go - more programming or math? This is a decent albeit more math oriented program. The same program online in Georgia Tech is more algorithm based in my opinion. The one at U of M is more business/CS inclined but more expensive. Depends on where you want to go. At the director level  are you wanting to scale business into DS? Then I would recommend a more CS/architecture program with enough math to understand when people are BSing you. If you’re not running crazy models in the next 10 years  you probably don’t need a large math background. If you’re trying to move into DS as a new field (didn’t read all the threads - apologies if you outlined this more) it really depends on what side of DS do you want to be on. The ML building algorithm side  hard stat side  or business side?
2684,__An open letter to curious readers on The Social Dilemma and how us readers should think about our roles in a capitalist dominant society:__  I think it was well done to give those who are unaware of data science’s use in industry. It gives a decent picture of what power exists behind data science and how it can smartly be used as one of the best tools for effective use of a product.   What these social media companies did  was not fueled by an intent of “dividing society.” These companies were fueled solely by profit — by capitalizing on the power of AI and creating an interface/platform that helps a user feel connected to themselves  all through the heavy lifting of this AI. The filtered results of information yielded more activity on their platforms which could statistically be measured out by numbers (clicks  likes  active screen time activity  etc.) Their sole intention was profit and I am sure that the thought of psychological effects was not heavily considered until the effects became more apparent in later years. Addiction is not immediately recognized and takes a while for it to be admitted.  And can you really blame a company for making money? A service must be provided by a company (social media provides interface for connecting people remotely)......but all of these platforms are free to sign up for and the people who worked hard on it have to find a way to feed their families. Perhaps if the service were government provided and capital were guaranteed  then the need for ads and psychological manipulation would not be integrated. However anecdotally  nobody trusts their government wherever they are from. So a model that still offers a user to freely create online profiles to tally and measure their friendships has to somehow meet revenue and that is why they turned towards ads.   As we have lived years with social media and begun to really understand how it controls out lives (hence why Im taking too much time out of my day to write this silly narrative that even you should question the legitimacy of)  we began to understand in our older years that friendship is arbitrary and that tallied measurements of friendship as a main indicating factor to us is very unimportant (hopefully for those who are mentally wiser and mentally healthier). Furthermore  these social media platforms and giant tech platforms began to transform into super highways of information travel  solely geared for instilling more clicks. Fake news is one the best weapons these platforms can use to generate activity. Internet news in general is already catered unethically to a manner which “clicks are equal to money”  and triggering mob-like emotion (positive or negative) in a user is what sells most. Fake news is much more effective at doing such because reality is mundane and fake is interesting. The AIs who do the computational  statistical  and mass-market “on the spot” dirty work for these platforms have developed much over time to understand this is what drives p
2685,Do you mean D&D is the Elder Scrolls of tabletop RPGs (5e = Skyrim)?  If so I'm totally on board with acknowledging that it is a popular game that many people customize to fit their play style and the devs don't try too hard to make it play one specific way on release.

2687,If you can  try to iterate on what you already know to be good but can be improved. That said  this means you will need to test new ideas as often and as cheaply as possible. The more you do this  the more your work will start to become it's own thing.

2690,I've been applying to entry level analyst positions without any luck so far. I have done quite a few projects with python  sql  and BI tools and feel pretty comfortable with them at this point. Should I keep focusing on working around sql and refining skills with Tableau/Power BI or would it be worth it to start doing some end-to-end ML projects?
2691,I’m hoping this Takata air bag drama will get people talking about the potential dangers of airbags.   Yes  modern and new airbags are very safe. But what about when they turn 20 or 30 years old  especially if they lived their life in a humid climate? What about first generation airbags in early 90s cars that don’t intelligently inflate and instead inflate fully and violently no matter how minor or major an accident is?

2696,"Hero System! It's an extremely comprehensive and well-integrated *system*  in a way that many games fail to achieve. That is  despite the very crunchy nature of the system  there's a few core mechanics that get consistently used throughout the rules. The core rules allow for a pretty detailed representation of any variation of human characters  and the super-power construction system is the best I've seen  and allows for good simulation of damn near anything. It's also well-supported with genre books  which cover genre tropes and how to model common genre elements using the basic rules. That is  the ""splatbooks"" for system *don't* introduce a bunch of new rules."
2697,I think there are three scenarios in which Data Scientists find themselves doing DE and SD work:  **Separate  fully mature IT and/or software development functions that don't have budget/resources allocated for DS**  That is  you have plenty of IT and SWD resources - but they are all allocated to solving the old/existing problems the company has  and when companies add data scientists  they do not account for the extra workload (or skillset required) to support that work. At these companies  things normally work themselves out - but it might take a year or two. You need IT/SWD to first realize they have a resource/skill deficiency  get additional headcount approved  get additional headcount hired  and get additional headcount onboarded. Depending on the company  that can take a while - but it will likely work itself out if the data science team is doing good work that just needs support to get implemented.  **Medium/large companies where IT/SD/DS and every other function that can do something with data is one comingled mess**  You see this a lot with legacy companies that are not native to tech  where they started an IT department to support excel  and over the years the function has grown to absorb anyone and everyone that knows how to work with computers. What you end up with are IT people with a ton of domain expertise  a bunch of stitched together systems  developers that are also product owners  and data scientists doing a bunch of data analysis. These are environments in which waiting until a developer has time to help you is a death sentence - it's just never going to happen - so the people that succeed are the people that take matters into their own hands and learn to do whatever they need to do  circumvent whatever limitations there are in place  and get stuff done.  **Small companies that don't have the resources to hire dedicated people for each function  and who don't necessarily expect enterprise-grade products**  Companies in early stages of their work who don't need to produce enterpride-grade products are probably fine with a DS building their infrastructure and products. They will work  they may even be pretty nice  but they are not going to have all of the elements that a fully developed solution would have.   What ends up happening at these companies is that when you get close enough to needing an enterprise solution  it will normally coincide with them having the resources to hire software developers. So again  the problem solves itself.
2698,People mentioned big companies  let me talk about startups:  In most startups dev resources are rare. Unless the core product of a startup is AI/ML (which for most it isn't)  there's a good chance dev resources are used to build basic key features a typical fake it till you make it startup product needs or they are needed to put out fires related to these features. This means you are often left alone without dev support  but often without the support of actual Product. This can eventually stabilize  but I've seen it happen quite often despite the ML pipelines being valuable to the company itself.
2699,You can definitely learn on your own  it's even more effective than going to a university since they tend to throw in a lot of useless classes not related to gamedev. The problem is... how do you know what things to learn? This is where an official education would help you  but if you know what subjects to read about then you're definitely better off on your own. College/Universities are honestly a big waste of time. Too much theory  too little practical knowledge.  I've answered this question a couple of times on these forums now  so I'll just copy-paste my list of things that a programmer should know to be considered professional and fully capable of coding a game. You obviously need to learn graphics on top of this  but this list should point you in the right direction:  &#x200B   1. A language (preferably C++  you can always learn other languages from there) 2. Rendering  shaders and 3d 3. Game-related math (mainly matrices and vectors) 4. Data structures and their use in games 5. AI : State machines  steering behaviours  decision trees  behaviour trees  etc. 6. Memory. How the stack and heap works  memory aligment and the cache. 7. General gameplay algorithms such as pathfinding (A\* and Djikstra) 8. Design patterns for games (Object pool  Flyweight  Factory  Command  Component  etc.) 9. Game engine design (learn Unity or Unreal  or make your own) 10. How to do optimization. Cache efficiency  culling methods such as Quad-trees  etc. 11. Network protocols (or at least how multiplayer games function)  If you're just interested in making your own game for fun  and not getting hired at a AAA game company  you can skip 2  11 and 10. Just pick an engine (I highly recommend Unity) and let it do the heavy lifting for you. And you obviously only delve as deeply as you feel necsessary into these subjects. No need to learn Behaviour Trees if you're not going to do a complex AI for example.
2700,It is impressive. All I did in my high school days was chasing tails and getting booze. (PS  I grew up in Italy and both were legal and encouraged).   Keep learning  some days I wish I did that more when I was your age.

2702,"So  this article is in a section tagged specifically ""Auto: Toyota""... so it seems to be written to tout Toyota as a brand. I was able to get past that cheesy paywall and they state this:  ""When you buy a new car  typically the dream is that you’ll be driving it around for a least a few years. If you’re really lucky  it might even still be in good enough shape down the line to pass it down to someone else when you’re ready for something new.  But some vehicles remain in the ***original owner’s possession*** for more than a decade after they’ve finished paying for them.""  So  the metric is apparently less about cars still on the road after 15 years but more about owners keeping specific models. Very misleading."
2703,>As I understand it  data science is a composite field at the intersection of computer science  mathematics  and statistics.  You forgot domain knowledge. Remember  data does not exist in a vacuum and you actually need to know the domain/field to make sense of it.  >I am frankly  very unclear on the extent to which this work relates to  AI as a subfield of data science. Is it mostly the same  is there  overlap  or  is it mostly irrelevant to data science (just a term in  common)?  You are unclear because the field itself is unclear on all these buzzwords. I think focusing on taxonomy of AI  data science  etc is a fruitless exercise because currently  there's so much disagreement that you are never gonna get a straight answer.

2705, So it's that (spooky) time of the year again  and since I love the setting of The Thing and Among Us (which is quite similar) is very popular right now  I figured I'd make a The Thing one-shot (even if it is really long). However  I have no idea how to do this. How would you all run this type of imposter scenario? Any tips and tricks on how to do it? Thanks
2706,My theory is that the reason why Python is harder to learn than R for statistics/data science (and I think it is) is because a lot of Python packages are just ugly attempts to hammer Python into a shape that looks like R. You're essentially coding for R via Python  which makes it even more confusing  because Python packages like pandas try to impose functionality onto Python that R is built with from the start  and it results in a mash-up that isn't intuitive for people used to either language.  That said  Python is better for just about everything else  which isn't surprising  given that R was written specifically for stats.
2707,Love this video!   I love in depth technical discussions on this stuff. Well  in depth enough to at least go down to the block diagram level. That's about as in depth as I want to go anyway  past that and it all kinda starts to go over my head.  Great video as always  thanks GN! You guys are awesome.
2708,I have a large data set that is too big for excel.  I need to aggregate data  make some data tables  maybe make a few visuals.  I'm always looking for opportunities to use Python at work since I want to build this skill set.  A few questions:   1. When a data set is too big to bring into Excel  is using a Jupyter Notebook and connecting to the database and doing the analysis in Pandas/Plotly etc. a good practice? Or is this slow and inefficient.  I should add that this may be something I need to repeat in the future. 2. If Python isn't the right tool  what is? Aggregating the data with SQL and then pulling it into Excel? Doing everything in Tableau? 3. If I do this in a Jupyter Notebook  what's the best way to give the results to someone so they can present it to a client? Copy and paste the data tables and graphs into excel or something?
2709,I'd say it depends on your DAW and your personal preference.  I have MIDI keyboards  but i often still resort to using my actual PC keyboard.  Especially gaming keyboards with full rollover support make decent replacements if your DAW supports playing them like a piano.
2710,If someone potentially asks you to perform a task in Excel  you will look bad if you can’t do it! The chances are that your business peers know excel  use excel and will expect whatever insights you give them to be attached to some excel data that they may want to look at.   You don’t need to be proficient in terms of formulae for instance  however you must know at least pivot tables and charts.
2711,I think this is a really compelling car. Mazda build quality and reliability with some decent power for once. The hatchback and AWD offers practicality and safety  especially in colder climates. I don’t usually buy new but I’ll have this in my sights in a few years. I’m eager to see what reviews say re handling. This seems to be a sore point for the current NAs.
2712,Think about how the terrain affects the challenges the players face. Maybe they are fighting a guerilla campaign against an invasion (or a counter insurgency against guerillas). How they use locations becomes really important - a steep gorge becomes a potential ambush site  a historic monument a chance to force the enemy to give battle.   Another possibility is that they are explorers sent to map a new territory with real objectives like sites for settlements  ports  river crossings and raw materials. They could be expected to find these  clear out resident monsters and negotiate access with local tribes.
2713,Sword Art Online  I'd say. I had seen a few anime prior to it  those being Pokémon (for many years prior actually)  Erased and The Seven Deadly Sins  but SAO really ended up making me want to watch lots of anime. I'm glad for that  too  because I used to be so bored on many days having literally nothing to do at all.
2714,In my experience  Visual Studio Code is incredibly faster  more stable  simpler and more customizable. It also integrates better with Git. But it has one major downside: the C# debugging experience is terrible compared to Visual Studio.  That being said  I've only used Visual Studio from Windows  and I've heard that the Mac edition is very different (verify  I'm not too sure about this).  If you could go with Visual Studio for Windows  I would recommend it to develop in C# with Unity. Also it depends whether you would prefer a customizable and fast IDE (VS Code) that you will have to configure yourself to suit your linking  or having a big monolithic IDE (Visual Studio) that comes by default with almost everything you could ever need.
2715,While not a Ferrari  I felt the same way the first time I drove an AMG. I’d driven a Corvette for years  but having the same speed in a sedan with much better interior and ride made me understand that speed alone isn’t everything.
2716,I have 2 years of experience and an MS.  I haven't had much luck applying online for jobs  although I have been recruited for a few roles that I was not as interested in compared to my current role.    How is it going with everyone else?
2717,I’m a night guard that works 10 hour shifts that can be boring. I need some good shows. Preferably comedy or action. Kinda a new guy to anime  Already saw Attack on Titan and my hero acedamia (and loved them)

2719,I think I said something similar in the first episode thread  but the Elf plot still intrigues me more than the human/knight plot... even with the recent revelation about him apparently being the former King's son (I hope that kingly sword he's gonna inherit isn't massively oversized  Not a big fan of WoW'ish weapons  and they really seem to like huge swords on this show).  Anyway  yeah the Elf stuff is much more interesting to me (Not sure if they intended it that way - probably not). They're 'on the good side' (kinda)  but they're not goody two shoes  they have their own somewhat misguided goals and all that. Makes them more interesting than the usual MC who wants to grow stronger to save everyone  who at some point learns he's the descendent of someone or the chosen one  etc.   Also want to see more of [sexy demon lady](https://imgur.com/UKXa0Wf)  for *ara ara* reasons.
2720,Check out LinkedIn and target some jobs that you might enjoy in SWE. See what the requirements are  then search for SWE in the “people” tab for that company to see what sort of background someone had who landed that job. Look at their projects  their listed skills  and experience  and start to replicate some of those things and draw paths from where you are to where they are.   I’m a fan of doing one thing well  then moving to the next thing  then making the 3rd thing doing 1 and 2 together. Build your data related or math-based model  implement a basic version in r or python  then find out how it might get deployed in the real world  using a full stack that is appropriate for the industry or company you’re hoping to work in. There’s enough resources about system design and algorithms online with people who have been generous to put basic project code up on github and even coach you or offer feedback if you reach out.   I’m in a similar position to you  and I’ve been finding pdf textbooks online and doing all of the associated projects and making sure to write them up carefully and put onto my github.   Further  you can find course websites that are accessible to the public and follow along with their projects and expectations. This will help you hold yourself to a standard not set by you  but by someone else. This simulates the working environment where the requests are from your boss or from a client.
2721,I have not worked with AWS IoT  but if it has similar functionality with Azure's IoT hub and IoT edge functionality  it should solve most of your problems. With Azure IoT edge you can write containerized docker modules in python and then deploy them on your devices.  So you can do almost anything you would normally.
2722,You’re building a custom workflow. There’s no tools that I’m aware of that will do what you’re asking for.. This seems inefficient and a lot of work to reproduce the sprites in voxels  You will need to import the individual “frame” models into your engine  setup a sequence  and use morph targets to transform between them.  A better alternative to what you are building is just import a 2D sprite sheet. Read the pixel data from the sprite sheet as usual. Create voxel data at runtime based on the sprite sheet pixels.
2723,Oregairu is great  if you want something that starts of rom-commy and evolves into more of a drama. Anybody can appreciate this show really.  Kaguya-sama: Love is War is probably the best rom-com I've watched  it just doesn't miss. Its characters are all well thought-out  the jokes absolutely slap  yet it also has really touching and depressing moments.  If you want something kinda harem-ish  Quintessential Quintuplets is pretty good  although there's only one season so far. Not bad either  although I'd recommend the other two before this.
2724,Hey   maybe someone can help me out  I'm pretty sure I saw a video a few days ago that I've been searching for over an hour now and can't find.  Basically a guy starts out with a blank piece of paper  drawing some shapes  scanning them and mapping them onto a plane. Progressing from there he builds a stylized prop ( I'm pretty sure it included some kind of propeller).  I'm sorry it's vague but maybe someone else saw it and can drop me a link  would be appreciated :)
2725,I hope some one can answer this question for me as it has puzzled me for the last 25 years...!  When did minivans start including tv screens in headrests?  Sometime in 1994-1995 I was a middle schooler.  My mom would wake me up every morning before sunrise to get ready for school and then she would go back to bed. My dad left for work earlier but would leave the TV on after watching the local news.   One morning after I had changed and am on my way to eat breakfast  I see this commercial for a minivan with tv screens in the back of the seats. I had never seen anything so cool and futuristic so I get really excited! Like my mouth is wide open and I’m staring at the screen and saying  “oh my god it’s the future!” I really really want to wake up my younger sister and my mom but I know I’ll get in trouble and also  it’s a commercial so I don’t even have enough time to do all that.  But I remember how exciting it was to see this cool new technological advance and the fact that it was already on the market was amazing.   I told my friends about it as soon as I got to school and they were also amazed but had never seen the commercial. When I got home I told my family about it and they were also impressed but hadn’t seen the commercial yet. No big deal because it was probably a new commercial.   I kept waiting to see the commercial again but it never came back. And nobody else ever saw it.  And then it wasn’t until around 2001 that I personally started seeing TV screens (and just one  not in multiple headsets in cars like that commercial !!!)  Every now and then I do a search online to find out the answer  or to find the actual commercial on YouTube or something but nothing.   So can any redditors help me out with this one?
2726,I used a stock HP keyboard to play CSGO for upwards of 5 years. Recently made the switch to a mechanical and I gotta say  I don’t see much of a difference.  EDIT: I actually tried 2 keyboards. A mecha-membrane and a mechanical. Never for the love of god buy a mecha-membrane if you play FPS. Never.
2727,I'm a big fan of BL manga  both yaoi and shounen-ai  but I don't really care for anime versions with rare exception. The thing that bothers me the most is the kissing sounds  and any grunting that goes with it. It grosses me out. Also  the animation is usually sub-par  so if there are any sex scenes  the movements are stilted or something. I prefer to just read the manga and let my imagination fill in the blanks.
2728,I'll tell you a small part of the story of a man I know personally.  At age 40  with no experience in finance  no legal background and 0 banking experience  he started working as a VP at a bank's operations department doing some analysis work. 20 years later he's a C-Suite at a top 100 US bank  throughout his banking career he's run various different departments  including the compliance department. (There was no nepotism or favoritism involved  he knew no-one at this bank when he started working there.)  This is obviously not the common story. His story is not comparable to his peers  but there are always outliers.  I don't know how to get from where you are to where you want to be. I do know there is more than one way to Carnegie Hall.
2729,Yes but you need to make sure all on car is well. Trans fluid  coolant  etc... make sure is new. I always suggest when you get a new used car always get fluids changed do it your self cheap but usually worth it. Now going to mods have fun but it's an expensive hole of losing money once you do one it won't stop.
2730,I am new to data science so please correct me if my assumption is wrong here... I would use the time column as another variable to be predicted along with the status... Not as a independent variable.. would that assumption make sense in real world application?
2731,Where the story is set is pretty important  as these things tend to be regional. Also  is the family flashy  or low-key wealthy?  I would say a solid choices either way is a Jaguar XJ6. 1980s Jags were almost transcendent for wealthy circles  as the upper-middle class lawyer  the new money multi-millionaire wall street banker  and the old money heir to a family fortune all would be perfectly matched driving an XJ6. It was like the Rolls Royce for the upper middle class  but since it was so beautiful  and drove better  a lot of people who could buy a Rolls or Bentley still chose the Jag.  Low key  but still very much a status symbol  a Mercedes wagon. Some of Mercedes Benz's wealthiest customers  to this day  buy an E-Class Wagon.  Range Rover and Jeep Grand Wagoneers are very popular choices in New England.  If you give us a little more of the character development and describe the family  how many kids  and what you see them as needed to do with the car  or portray to others with their choice in vehicle  we could match you up pretty well with the perfect car.
2732,Remember: you don't have to play an entire several years' campaign in one system.  If you like a lot of games  then explore! Form a club or group to do one-shots and adventures that last for a month or two  then move on. Or move between groups.  Also remember  this is a lifetime hobby for many of us. You will have years and years  God willing  to explore a bunch of games out there. You will almost certainly get to enjoy mind-blowing games that haven't even been invented yet.  So I say: don't ask what one system you should stick with. You're getting a bunch of generic RPGs where covering as much territory as possible is a priority  but that's not necessarily what you want.  Ask what system you should _start with._ And the answer there should always begin with: what sort of game do you feel like playing right now?
2733,I want to like Stars Without Number but its old school design approach doesn't appeal to me  **is there a more modern sci-fi game out there for me?**   **I'm looking for:**   * A spacefaring sci-fi RPG * Something that has tools for creating a sci fi world like SWN's sector creation tools. * Something that allows for hard or low fantasy  more human-centric and without fantasy elements  something more Firefly than Star Wars. * Something not too complicated  I’m fine with a bit of crunch big Traveller is too complicated for me.
2734,Does anyone remember the name of an RPG  where players are the members of a modern resistance movement working against a totalitarian state  and you are writing letters to each other? IIRC it used a standard deck of cards for resolution/prompts. Been searching for it for ages now and cannot remember the title.
2735,"the most likely possibility seems like Kopite mis-identified it as Navi 21 when it's really Navi 22.  It seems unlikely you could feed a 3080 tier chip off a 256-bit bus.  technically I guess it could be a really cut-down 21 but there's not really any reason you'd want to do your engineering work on broken/harvested chips pressed into service  AMD is not *that* hard up for engineering samples.  If that's the situation they're in then they're in deep shit because this has to yield production level quantities in a matter of months  if you can't even get enough engineering samples you're boned.  But I don't think that's the case.  I suppose another possibility is that it's a 21 designed as a ""22 simulacrum""  it's the same architecture and all so there's no reason you couldn't take a 21  clip it down to the appropriate configuration to represent a 22  and then start working on that before you have actual 22 silicon.  I see no reason to think this has anything to do with HBM.  That's wishful thinking I think.  HBM would have a bus that is some multiple of 512b."
2736,Played the Open Beta. Game is hot trash. The gameplay is horrendously repetitive and controls and combat system feels wonky. Felt off during the whole 5 hours playthrough I had. Save your money for Cyperpunk or something else.
2737,So if y’all have been on YouTube you might see new videos from Linus and MKBHD and maybe others showing off the 3090 and 60 FPS gaming at 8K.  I’ve only seen the Linus video at this point  but he seemed pretty blown away by it.  According to the TV pixel density resolution charts from the guys over at RTings.com  the human eye needs to be really close to a display to see the difference between 8K and 4K. See [here](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship).  For example   For an 85 inch TV  which is about the size Linus has in the video  you need to be closer than about 5 feet to even be able to tell a difference.  My TV is 55 inches and I watch it at about 8 feet. If it was 8K I’d need to closer than 3.5 feet to even tell it was higher resolution than 4K  which just seems ridiculous to me.  If the difference is so subtle  why is Linus so exaggerated about it in the video? Is this just marketing hype and the reviewers have sold out  or am I missing something?  Edit: Many people are suggesting that it will happen  but take time for hardware to get to 8k (GPUs & TVs). I understand that we could theoretically get there  my question is if it will ever be mainstream granted 95% of the people won't be able to tell the difference between 4K and 8K in a blind cross over.
2738,The Alicization LNs (Volume 9 - 18) are so much more detailed than the Alicization Anime. That said  the anime does a great job at adapting the core of the story and the important details about how everything works.  The Light Novels  however  are way more Sci-Fi than you would have thought they are from the anime.   Asuna also feels a lot more important in the LNs  way more than the anime. The LN treats her like a proper main character. The anime undermines her character during Alicization a lot. The LNs also prioritise the Asuna and Kirito relationship way more. Since it’s supposed to be Kirito and Asuna’s story.   The LN also has way more character depth and development than the anime. Especially for Eugeo  and other side characters such as Fanatio’s Four Whirling Blade.
2739,Hi there. Just sharing some thoughts about car infotainment (the 'screens') and how we are forced to interact with newer cars these days.   For reference:  * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hn31vLKgho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hn31vLKgho) (carwow ID3 review) * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmL\_QbUwvsg&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmL_QbUwvsg&t=2s) (top gear golf GTI 8th gen)  As an introduction  I'm not a boomer. I'm not a tech Luddite or opposed to tech at all (used to buy all sorts of tech stuff  assemble my own pc's...). And I've always been a fan of all things related to cars.   What I see now in the cockpit of most recent model cars is deeply concerning  and incredibly wasteful and frustrating.   What I believe is happening is   * extreme cost-cutting  buttons are more expensive than a large slab of screen where brands can put all the buttons on at will. * hipsters are breaking into the design and R&D labs and upper management  forcing their '*everything needs to look futuristic or bust*' approach hard-line into the all the design meetings.  * Trying to appeal to less tech savvy customers with the initial wow-effect of all those screens and fancy user interfaces  The risks or consequences:  * frustrating user experience from laggy screens  laggy UI  badly designed UI (stuff and UI always swooping and switching places all over the place  inconsistently designed menus  updates creating a mess). Poor touchscreen response * Badly designed UI will lead to more distractions  more on that in a bit * Maintenance and keeping your car on the road will be impossible. Vehicles aren't cars anymore  they're a bunch of real world mechanical hardware attached to a second or third rate 'chinese phone/tv' equivalent  ready to be binned when none of the systems are responsive enough to still be used.  * With the way tech moves on  how will you find a printboard/screen/cpu/whatever in a few years time if things do fail? The company in question will have moved on 2  3 models by then. Or will be bankrupt and only TESLA will still be making cars  either way no one will care * Mechanics and shops will NOT be able to help you deal with these issues  nor will you be able to troubleshoot something yourself ever again.  * When tying all your car controls together through one centralized system  you create one single BIG point of failure. A bug  broken boards (in a vehicle subjected to constant vibrations!) and everything is dead. I can live with a car with a broken radio button. Or a broken left side air con button  or a broken fan somewhere (depending on circumstance). Once the screen goes  everything goes and nothing is working  &#x200B   Then there is the consideration that most of this crap will probably be very badly designed. Every brand will want something along those lines ('cause it's cool and the others have it') but most will not be able to develop or source a good system/solution for their car infotainment.   They will have a few in-h
2740,People are social animals and some of us like cars. If you'd be that bothered by someone complimenting your car or asking for a picture  then don't upgrade and keep it moving. It's not many other options you have though I think you overestimate the reactions people will have but that's my opinion. It's ironic you say you don't want to draw attention yet buy yeezys and other shoes that most people don't wear.
2741,You're low on cash  and we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic. You need an indie mechanic who can source you a good used and warrantied stock replacement engine. The replacement with labor alone will run you $2-3k.   Aside from any sentimental value  your car has little to no collector value and any money you spend on upgrades is basically being lit on fire.   Project cars suck when you're broke. Stay the course and turn this into your project when you have a reliable daily and expendable income.
2742,Sometimes I don't play anything for months but then I spend a week in an unoptimized AAA  game. I feel bad for all this powerful hardware just sitting in my house  depreciating  only to be used sparingly.      I hope with 5G sub-15ms input to screen latencies become reality so I can rent extra GPU power for a weekend.      edit: from +6 to negative  damn reddit is something else.
2743,Not everyone knows this but the game already had a sequel called Ghoul Patrol.  You even play as the same kids.  I only learned this when I picked it up cheap 2nd hand as a kid  pop in the cart and there you go  it's basically Zombies 2.
2744,Math  statistics  coding  isn't hard.... Trust me. At least not as hard as trying to understand humans.  You can always improve yourself if you're passionate about the field. But if you're in for the money that people says comes from this field  you'll end up being frustrated.
2745,Comments here are amazing lot to learn ... I want to just add few cents first few interviews are there to get warm up do not take them too seriously ... data science is the future ... most of the data science project take long time to get business results and it is hard to find patience in business owners ... most of the leaders solve it by infusing data analysis which could get results faster ... I would suggest keep giving interviews ... look outside your city and country as you are in Europe ... it will be short time you have to spend out to gain experience ... you could be lucky to get remote work as well as it COVID year ... focus on the team do not compromise with group you are joining you might get  more money ... when you are giving interview make sure their challenges interest you ... if you have already worked on training earlier you can build you own course on Udemy or use teachable ... I will be happy to help in any way I can please feel free
2746,AFAIK the series x achieves its split by using a mix of 1 and 2GB modules. To get this series s split in a similar way  you'd need 3 * 2GB + 1 * 4GB modules.  edit: Wasn't sure if 4GB G6 modules actually existed  looks like the Quadro RTX actually use 24x 2GB mounted on both sides  not just 12 chips. Could be a similar situation here if the last 32bits of the bus are spread across 2 modules?
2747,This is a huge fuckup.  I wasn't planning on buying an AMD card  but now they've practically left me no choice but to at least seriously consider it  since I physically can't buy any of their cards.  They had their chance to sell as much as possible before Navi comes out  but it looks like they couldn't capitalize on it.
2748,I have brought my current car to firestone to get quotes both times I needed a larger repair  and when I got a quote comparison from a local shop it was less than half the firestone price both times.       The place I found is an absolute gem  super friendly  always ready super fast  and they do good work.  Here's the thing though  driving past you can barely tell its open  they take cash only  they write your info down on paper and don't have fancy computer systems.       If your electronics are failing perhaps you need to go to the dealer or something.  But if its mechanical  do yourself a favor and find a mechanic who doesn't waste your money on branding  ads  franchise fees  and making the building look nice.       Thank you to the honest mechanics out there!
2749,So I have been DMing a game off and on for a number of years now and I think I am ok at it but definitely not great. However  I find it more rewarding to DM over playing and most of my group would rather play than DM so it's the perfect fit. The problem being that I want to do as good a job as I can and I have received feedback that combat is tedious and boring.   As far as I can gather  the players are fine with my DM style when they are going around the town  talking to NPCs etc. but as so as combat starts everything falls apart. I really struggle to keep track of distances between people and enemies as well as HP etc. I think part of this is due to the fact that I don't really have any aid in terms of models or a grid etc. I'd love to have fully painted models and fully made terrain but as it stands at the moment I don't have the time to make the terrain between sessions  nor do I have the money to buy things (I am just affording the rulebooks etc. as is).  Are there any easy ways that I can make combat better? I don't think it will be perfect  I just want it to be better. In a couple days I have agreed to run one of the starter scenarios from the Call of Cthulhu starter set with a few friends. I know combat is much less of a feature of that system as compared to something like D&D but I'd like it to be better nonetheless.   Basically  I want to do my best for the players since I have fun when they have fun but I am not really sure how I can improve what I am doing as I struggle to track a lot of things at once  my players really like visual/physical aids and I don't have a lot of money.  Any ideas are appreciated.
2750,[https://youtu.be/eh0nS7qABgY](https://youtu.be/eh0nS7qABgY)   Packed with funny historical musings  and- AND - the FIRST Electric Dice Podcast Animated INTRO! A First look & Impressions video on the SUCCESSFULLY FUNDED Flames of Freedom Kickstarter!     I was in a position to do some playtesting for the game and its quick-start adventure  and made a video of some of the best parts of our games and of our group going through character generation. I would love to hear any questions you may have  or any feedback on our video.     Do you have a story you want to tell in Colonial America?
2751,The second looks more approachable. But still  if you don't have experience in programming  this will take you some time to learn. Unless you copy-paste other's code. In that case  Unity has hundreds of already made projects you can copy-paste and modify. But still  you need to know what a method  a class or an attribute is. A simple Pong game could take you a couple of weeks if you have zero experience  an Arkanoid could take you more than that  the next MMO multiplayer WOW -> impossible.  Good luck sir
2752,agreed. Sometimes you fuck up and you can ask your employees to help you fix it  so long as overtime gets paid and overtime isn't imposed on anyone. I appreciate CD projeckt red's transparency about what they had to do in the last few weeks to assure the games quality. It's not a compromise on your morality and labor ethics if you admit that crunch might be necessary sometimes. It's happened at my job where I stayed at work for 12 hours to fix critical issues.
2753,I haven't heard anything about new announcements. They showed a special video for Dr. Stone season 2 and aired an anime special for Boukyaku Battery. That's all I know so far. There's still the main Jump Festa event on December 19 and 20. Some announcements could be made there.
2754,i would go up to a 700-750w power supply. (just for future upgrade  and effeciancy)  do not but windows 10. get the software for free from microsoft website  and buy a key online. (i bought 3 this week for about $5 each)  and if your planning on upgrading the gpu  i wouldnt get anything that expensive  maybe a second hand 10 series? (resale prices are dropping like crazy)  &#x200B   just on a side note  if this is your first build  why are you going so crazy with it? (im an enthusiast  and i like my high end hardware) but it just seems a little over the top. IMO

I just went and looked at a Mazda 323f for 1000 euros  and all the fluids were the wrong colors  and there was a lot of air coming out of the oil cap and some other bad signs  and now I feel a bit discouraged. Are all cars this cheap going to be in this condition? My plan is to just get a shitbox for the winter maybe  to get some ""flight hours"" under my belt  and get something more exciting and RWD come spring. But then also I don't really know whether I'll have an opportunity to change it then  so that's why its gotta be at least somewhat decent and reliable.    >   >Just looking for general advice really since a lot about owning a car is still a mystery to me."
2756,Original Hellsing... now i wouldn't call it trash by any means (which means that perhaps i should not mention it in this thread) but holy shit i can't think of any other anime being carried by soundtrack THIS hard. I even tried to find similar music to it but its just too avant-garde to find anything similar to it.
2757,I thought I had read an article saying one of the issues with Infinite was the outsourcing. Bringing in a writer might not have the kind of understanding of how to manage these multiple outsourced workers in a way that even EA could not do for Andromeda
2758,Watching tutorials can be better  since you get to see the work flow of people who spent days if not weeks solving a problem and then passing on their knowledge to the viewer. Besides that  it sounds like you need a specific game idea  then break it down into manageable chunks and start piecing things together. The hardest part is always getting started and having the confidence to accept failure.
2759,I remember (from a bootcamp) first generating a heatmap that correlate each dimention with the target  but it also shows how these dimensions correlate with each other:  - dimensions correlating the most with the target should be kept. Call them X  - dimensions highly correlating with the X dimensions should be removed  because they add redundancy to the model.  - you can try PCA and add PCA components to the data and include them in the correlation heatmap to see if they effectively correlate higher.  - You mentioned having an imbalanced dataset. You can start with multiple models (also means multiple correlation heatmaps)  or you can try the imbalanced-learn library  I’ve tried it multiple times with success.
2760,Maybe I’m just getting old and “get off my lawn”-y  but is anyone actually sold on a game by these kinds of cinematic trailers with zero gameplay?   I mean Rocket League is a great game   I just don’t see who this kind of trailer is aimed at. Show some gameplay in your trailers  dang it
2761,Dere is just an archetype that indicates how a character loves. Tsun is a shy/rejecting love  Yan is a crazy love  Genki is an upbeat love  Kuu is a cool/calm love.   I guess the term for a normal love archetype would be Futsudere  though that probably doesn't actually exist.
2762,I have a few ideas.  For starters  look into OSR games like Old School Essentials which leave out social skills entirely.  DnD Basic and Expert left social skills entirely out  role playing is entirely up to the players.

2764, Hi       I've been working on a game for the past few years and I completed it to  the point where I'm starting to think about the next steps in getting  it out there. Obviously this would involve creating some sort of legal  entity for the business  running a crowd funding campaign  hiring people  and renting server space to host the service  but while I'm confident  about the product itself  I have 0 business experience and can't quite  put together what steps I need to take in what order next for this game  to take off.      The specifics of the game: It is a PC chess variant that with some work  could be ported to Mac and mobile. The finishing touches I can't do  myself and therefore need the funds from crowdfunding to complete are  upgrading the graphics  some serious playtesting and adding the features  that involve real money transactions.      I'm currently in Hungary  but would be happy to establish whatever legal  entity is the most practical in pretty much any part of the world for  the best conditions.      I'm looking for any advice on how to proceed from here.      Thank you     zoliking

2766,TL DR   Most games struggle to hit even 30 fps at 8K (a lot of them were only running in DLSS  mind you)  others just simply won't even run due to the 10 GB of VRAM.  If you want to play at 8K  go with the 3090... whoever you are. Even then some titles still need DLSS to be playable  Edit: The thumbnail got updated  nice. Thank you /u/3kliksphilip
2767,I use notion as well to have my own handbook for processes  prior solved problems  code snippets and tools. Besides that I have a Python script that passes commands that I use frequently directly to the shell with just 1 click to transform/check data sets. Also I have gathered a few templates for OpenRefine. Useful when cleaning small/medium datasets for the same database/tool structure over again. And a few small webscrapers when I am lazy. Some of them aren’t even „scrapers“ as they basically just loop through pressing download buttons but...I rather run a script and take a coffee break while it downloads than doing it manually.
2768,Let yourself believe in your players enjoyment  believe in yourself  if they were not having fun they would tell you or stop playing. Accept the good feedback they have given and allow it to bolster and inspire you  remember that 90 percent of what happens in game is based on things they players choose to do. Let them have freedom to choose  and enjoy the game you are all creating together!
2769,Memories  misty water colored memories.....  (of paying)  £255 for a new EVGA 970 SSC (it was a special version of the SSC as well)  £520 for a new PNY 1080 FE (shortly after launch  includes a £70 ebay discount  still felt that was more than I should have paid on a card)  \~£320 for an EVGA 2070 XC  nearly new  six months after launch.  Jeez  I was sure I was ripping myself off for that last one. But if I've got a lucky escape  it just means the rest of the market is being taken advantage of. Again.
2770,Hi all  Finishing up my undergrad as a biochem major  but with lots and lots of stats/ coding mixed in because I knew I was interested in this field. What masters program would you recommend I pursue if my undergrad isn’t directly in Data/com sci or engineering? Or should getting my undergrad in one of these have been a must Not opposed to another year an a half if undergrad in math/data sci is a must. All help is appreciated :)
2771,The job title at your company never comes into consideration in my review. Only what you've done there.  For context  I run a reasonably sized group of folks (\~40) doing a broad set of this work  have interviewed maybe 200 people over the past few years and looked at the resumes of another few hundred.
2772,"I'm working on getting an old game on IOS working and the last patch notes stated that some devices didn't work because ""\[the devices\] don't have enough processing power to support our 3D physics engine."" The devices listed here: ""Prospectors won't run on iPhone 5S or older  iPod Touch 5 or older  and iPad 1""  I sort of need a confirmation that going forward I need to check for ram specs since I found this:  ""Note: unfortunately  the game won't run on lower memory 512MB RAM devices""  It basically says get something with 1 GB or more. I'm taking this as I need to buy a device with 1 GB and hope the speeds aren't too important. I'm juggling the iPad 3 and 4 since they didn't update to IOS  11. The iPad 3 (IOS 9) would probably be more stable but the 4 (IOS 10) had faster RAM. Can I get some advice for whether to buy the 3 or 4? I suspect that either could work but the 3 is more likely to be slower. The 4 however  may not be able to play the game due to some compatibility reason."
2773,Value of edX MicroMasters  I just graduated with an undergraduate degree in math  and am planning to apply for a full time Masters in Data Science ( or possibly Robotics/Systems type ML) in the next year or two. My question is - will completing the MITx Statistics and Data Science MicroMasters program make me a more competitive applicant? I am genuinely interested in taking the course to learn  but am trying to figure out whether it makes sense to pay over a thousand dollars to get the actual credential. If I thought I could get into a better Masters program as a result  it would be worth it to me.
2774,The problem you are having is a real-world  interpersonal problem  not an RPG problem. Why are you asking an RPG subreddit to solve it for you? The solution is exactly the same as if you encountered this person in any other aspect of your life.
2775,Well...every single one I've ever met tends not have too much of a clue without a technical capacity and did a course for 3 days at a well paid Ivy league college oh and did a 1 day Harvard Business Review course just before they were zombified by working at Mckinsey...then drove the business to the ground while riding high on the last senior who left with a pay out. Then jumps to a promotion elsewhere to let the next Mckinsey zombie drive it further down.  Oh did you mean a good one...oh right...er well their like a unicorn. Jump on board and ride with them and don't let go. You'll learn alot because they don't ever call themselves a leader but you feel and know they are by their actions.
2776,I'm just not smrt enough to do High without hitting my head against every trope in the three-volume book.   With history-based settings  with actual history already being crazy  I will end up coming up with crazy stuff just by following the recipe. And adding little fish men.  True  it's Low  but it's crazy. And has fish men.
2777,"Is that a good ""villain"" idea ?   A cleric who goes around resurrecting random dead bodies. Unfortunately he somehow always pick evil people. Not evil himself but he's about as dumb as a bag of rocks and convinced he is saving the world."
2778,As you said  it is mostly tradition. Right now there is not many arm CPUs optimized for ultimate performance  which is required in desktop and many servers. And a lot of people is locked with software for amd64 (especially things like games).  We do see arm in some servers and laptops/chromebooks now. We see them in home NAS devices  we see them in up cameras  we see them in network gear (switches  access points  small home routers)  we see them in media boxes / players  and SBCs. I wish there was a small atx board with arm  and had a decent performance  but right now there is only one sich thing available  price is meh  and performance is meh. I would grab it myself  if only performance/value metric was better than it is now.  As of mobile  arm was cheaper and there were no reasonable alternatives  and got popular. Amd64 could be used in mobile and even be competitive  but it is not easy.

2780,Radeon: *My time has come.*  &#x200B   Seriously though  NVIDIA has seriously screwed up this launch. I mean  how hard would it be for them to have some sort of queue system  where you pre-order the card and it ships as soon as they have a unit for you?
2781,I don’t even care about texture updates  I’m old enough that as long as we’re not using block hands circa Deus Ex 1 graphics  it’s good enough.   Just want integrated DLC storylines and a proper ending (and at least the ME 3 dlc gave us some closing for the characters  even if they don’t change the infamous last chapter).
2782,Ugh  this was awful. Bad voice acting all around  really bland visuals. But the worst offense was just how boring it was.A show about comedians should be hilarious  but these people are horribly unfunny. Definite drop for me.
2783,From obnoxious fanboys  to a curious breadth of driver archetypes. What brand fanbase intrigues you the most? It could be a brand or a specific car model.  Regarding brands  I've always found Proton fans to be quite interesting. Proton hasn't created a great number of iconic cars. They don't get much respect in [the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VhHMcTGByE) or Australia  or even in their home market of Malaysia (until recently). But it seems like many Malaysians have a national pride in the formerly government-owned car manufacturer.  There's a huge tuner scene that's almost reminiscent of the JDM culture in countries like the USA  from the [Evo-converted Mitsubishi-based Protons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKeVNpKuDuU) to [entire body changes](https://paultan.org/2018/12/12/proton-preve-based-invictus-by-asia-pacific-uni-wins-proton-drb-hicom-creative-car-challenge-2018/). People still covet the old Satria GTi (a Malaysian Mitsubishi Colt with Lotus tuning) and even the newer Satria Neo (including [a special edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Satria_R3#Proton_Satria_Neo_R3_Lotus_Racing)  carbon-fibre-filled [Lotus variant](http://www.speedhunters.com/2018/11/the-peoples-car-of-malaysia-proton-satria-neo-r3-lotus-racing/) that makes 145hp and costs the equivalent of USD 27k).  If an article or YouTube video so much as makes a passing mention about Proton  you might find Malaysians flocking to the comments. Especially if it's about Geely's acquisition of Lotus (Proton was Lotus's previous owner)  but leaves out any mention of Geely's near-50% ownership of Proton.  Speaking of Geely  the Geely partnership has produced two rebadged crossovers  the [X70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLCwOnJcFJE) and [X50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTPFivIuRto&t). By all accounts  they're [genuinely good cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAnLUvZkIrA)  and now Malaysians are becoming proud of Proton again. I honestly have this soft-spot and neighbourly pride for the Malaysians' first car brand.  In terms of individual models... I can't think of anything in particular. Please share if you can lol
2784,Easiest way  dont press the clutch  just brake until the speed is low and revs close to idle (then downshift to 3rd or 2nd) and just before the full stop you depress the clutch and put into neutral.   The longer you keep the car in gear the longer fuel is cut and you wont burn your clutch either.
2785,You'd have to do it online/PBEM.  That way when the Thing replaced someone no one else would know because it happened in a 1 on 1 sesh with the player.  A replaced player would play as normal  but with a new objective and monster powers.  Play end when the PCs kill the Thing  when there are no more PCs or when the Thing escapes to the mainland.
2786,The extra range of movement allows for more precision and minute adjustments mostly. With F1 it's all about speed  and having to go hand-over-hand through those lightning-fast turns would be a problem.  Also F1 cars generally neither have nor need as tight a turning radius as a street car  they don't have to navigate tightly-packed parking lots.
2787,"Startup experience is terrible because you're stuck in ""learn on your own"" mode. There isn't a bunch of much more experienced people to tell you whether you're learning the right things or actually learning at all or just spinning in circles. Unless there is proof (github portfolio etc.) I'd lump startup experience in the same category as hackathons  course projects and personal projects. Better than nothing  but not professional experience.  Academic experience is similar. The professor hasn't ever worked a real job  they're stuck in their little academic bubble where a project is summed up in a 5 page paper and that's it. The code is a bunch of spaghetti and it's okay  because nobody cares about it. In the professional world  this doesn't cut it.  You sound like a typical research assistant. A guy they hired to be the matlab (nowadays numpy) bitch. I'll be quite frank with you: this experience is not very valuable. It's on the same level as homework in a course. It's better than nothing  but you're not really ahead of any other self-taught sucker out there which is why you get rejected all the time and other companies don't even call you in for an interview.  From the company's perspective  you're a fresh grad with basically no experience."
2788,It's probably a good chance this is a power supply problem. You're going to need to do some load testing on  it to confirm.   First thing you're Gonna need are a couple of tools   Grab - furmark https://geeks3d.com/furmark/   and HW monitor if you don't have a way to see voltages   https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html  Run HWmonitor and note the voltages at idle the 12v MUST be above 11.4.   Next you're going to run Furmark (in a window not full screen) and watch for a drop in voltage  on HW monitor less drop is better if the voltage drops to 11.5 or less you should replace the power supply.
2789,I am deciding which software to continue with for future career potential. I'm currently going into my masters in clinical research and have to pick one of these two. So far I know SPSS really well  but it isn't as powerful as R and SAS. My masters is within the clinical research realm in healthcare  and my hopes is to become a physician afterwards incorporating research  but won't be doing research full-time. Thus I want to pick a software that allows me to learn fast  program/analyze data fast  give me clear results and analysis  and a software that will still be popular for the next 30 years.  Also the biostatistician on my floor who helps me out a lot uses SAS + SPSS exclusively  but there is a PhD student that uses R that I can get help from. There's also STATA I could learn  which another PhD student uses  though I would have to pay for that  while SAS (now free) and R are free of cost for non-commercial use.  &#x200B   Which software would you advise me to utilize in this case?

2792,The person knew how to solder but now how to desolder?    Explanation:  The connector was damaged  probably by plugging in the cable at the wrong angle  so the person tried to solder a SATA power extension cable because he or she had no spare connector for the circuit board and didn't have the skills or equipment to remove the broken connector and install a replacement.
2793,An understanding of climate science as communicated is important. Read through the IPCC summary for policymakers  for example. You can't model if you don't understand  after all.  Then  you can get specific about the actual areas you're expected to model. An assessment on the expectation of future sea swells in Western Europe  for example  impacts on crop production  etc etc.
2794,"It's no secret that when a company like TSMC first move to a new manufacturing process  like 7nm  yields are relatively poor  prices high  and the potential performance of a given processor architecture developed on that process limited. However as time goes on  those yields are improved  costs come down  and the performance potential increases in the form of increased overclocking headroom.  But what  exactly  does this ""maturing"" entail? It's obviously nothing automatic  like a wine that passively gets better with time. Something happens within the semiconductor company. Is it a change in the lithography machines  hardware changes & fine-tunings allowing for better precision in the lithography process  is it a greater understanding of said machines by their operators such that they're better able to extract more performant silicon out of them?  I was spurred to ask this when listening to Buildzoid from Actually Hardcore Overclocking in a recent video  where he talks about his launch week Ryzen 7 3700X not being able to hit 4.1 GHz all core  but recently produced 3700X's hitting 4.4  4.5  or even 4.6 GHz with cranked up voltages (in the context of his OC-centric  score-seeking world  I assume  not any long term stable day to day OC). That's a significant change on the same architecture  built on the same process using presumably the same machines.  Any insight on the subject would be most welcome. Thank you."
2795,Hi!  I’m a self-employed worker who works from home and an office. When I was employed by a company several years ago they had something setup that anything that was uploaded to a server was accessible in the C drive of any employees computer. I’d love the option to leave me laptop at home and get a tower for my office and anything I do on either computer has that option. Not a big fan of having to download each file or do something like Google Drive. Does anyone know a program that I can download on each computer and it auto saves documents that can be accessible through a folder on either computer  on different networks? Hope that makes sense!!  Thanks!
2796,I think it's more of a question of what pleases you aesthetically. The second question would then be  how would this art style work in motion. Logically  the third question is  can I create this style or do I need somebody who will produce art for me.  Video game art ranges from detailed to ultra minimalistic. What I learned through observation is that the best way of choosing a graphic look is through gameplay needs.  Since you mentioned pixel art: I think many indie developers make use of it because it's relatively easy to produce. It's minimalistic  nostalgic and (most importantly) get's the job done.

2798,My biggest flaw has definitely been letting player characters die. I used to actually nerf bosses a bit just to help keep the party alive at key moments  I've since gotten better at this. It took me awhile to realize that players aren't going to stop playing because they're character died and it can actually be fun to work a new character into a party.
2799,I don't know where the text from my post went... I'm having high memory issues with Windows 10 and I'm wondering if someone can look at this and offer an explanation? Sometimes the CPU is high as well  but mostly memory.
2800,So the car gained ~17hp in 10 years? Eh.  I'm exactly the kind of person who could be interested in a BRZ  and I wish the car made a more compelling argument because I think they look really good  but at 400lbs heavier than a Miata it's not really light anymore. Yes I know 2 800lbs is still light for a new car in 2020 but if I'm going light why would I not save 400lbs with a Miata? They could have given it more power to make up for the weight but they didn't. In the end it's a car that is neither light enough nor powerful enough.
2801,I work in a scrum team and it works pretty well. Scrum isn’t made to be done by the books. We switched some techniques around and adapted it to our needs. But it is surely based around the fundation that everyone does everything in our team (8 people btw).
2802,I wish more reviewers evaluated monitors similarly to HUB and Rtings.com. There are a lot of things to consider in monitors  like response time and backlight strobing  that too few YouTubers either care about or measure properly.
2803,They might be better optioned in base spec  but imo the tech and overall interior comfort isn’t as good in cheaper cars. I find the tech in cheaper cars is slower  not intuitive and poorly thought out. Whereas in a BMW  Merc or Audi it just seems better thought out and just works better.     Maybe it’s subconscious  but it feels better to me and I suppose that is what matters.
2804,I always thought the whole naming convention even when the article says it was simple was not and was purposely designed to be confusing so OEMs could make their shitty laptops appear to be better than they every had a chance of being. Naming a notebook chip with a U with similar numbers to desktop chip that kicks the shit out of it was never ever once done in good conscious. It was definitely something the marketing team came up with.
2805,Albert Biermann did a series of interviews with the German YT channel JP Performance. In the third video  the latter got to drive a prototype i20N.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sNMxJkFyYzE  Biermann says that the engine is 20% underneath their targeted power output. If it’s supposed to be the 201-hp 1.6T from the Veloster/i30  could this mean that the i20N might outgun the Fiesta St and Polo GTi?
2806,Okay  you guys just downvote me.   I know most people in r/cars don’t like r/Teslamotors . Seriously  Model 3 doesn’t have good quality  decent handling  and good interior  but it takes Lexus IS territory.
2807,I don't think so data science will be subset of software engineering. Designing a solution will still be required. But I expect as the field matures. The hype around data science will reduce and remaining work will be picked up other roles. The new roles like machine learning engineering and Data engineering will get far more hype. Data science is going to be more math and stats heavy
2808,Yes  but not because Nvidia engineers finally have what they need (tech wise) to make a good one.  If anything  it's the other way around - Nvidia finally has access to the great Arm CPU designers that it could fund to make it a great desktop CPU  just like they have done it for smartphones and servers.
2809,Hi it’s me  a 26 year old drifter that’s probably throwing under glow on this off season.  You know what? I grew up with nfsu2. It got me into drifting. And it made me a huge fan of the overblown tuner styles of the late 90’s and early 2000’s. I lived in that world. Shit  I have a rip on my laptop and play it anytime I’m traveling on a plane. Every single car I had was rocking under glow. It’s COOL.   And now  everyone just like me has suddenly realized we’re solidly beginning our careers  a few years in  and have a little cash to spend on some stuff like LED underglow. That’s my guess. I’m 4 years into my career  and even after wasting money the whole time on my car hobbies I can still put down a few bucks for some underglow. I made it!
2810,GURPs will let you do whatever the heck you want and all within the core rules. Yes there will be some extensions of rules but  by and large  you'll be set with the core system. 4th Ed looks like it would be your best bet. I'm a 3rd Ed man and I've managed games of this scale with the core book  Martial arts  Magic and China books.
2811,For Mercedes in LA  mike at Johanns on la Brea is great  although they may be closing bc their building was sold to tear down and put up a hotel.   Aram at Vaco is also good  especially for older Mercedes and body work  I’ve heard good things about Beverly laurel too.
2812,"In Python  strings are always quoted. If it's your column or row names  and you want to access them  you use quotes. In R  it depends. Are you using data.frame or data.tables (or tbls  I guess  but I primarily stuck to data.table rather than Tidyverse)? Are you using formulas (which not only have bare strings  but no containing structure *of any kind*)? It all depends.  More generally  the problem with R is that for anything you want to do  there are five ways to do it  and three of them are wrong. Sure  if you become an expert at R you'll know the best ways to do everything  but for a beginner? Even something as simple as ""how do I create an ROC curve?"" sends you down a rabbit-hole of comparing different packages."
2813,but it *IS* all smoke and mirrors  *right*? We all know there is no complete world and the plot won't win a price. I'm not sure it's even possible to be an imposter GM  especially compared to certain players arriving at the table and having done no prep whatsoever.   Just knowing some rules and having some NPCs gets a pass imo  Also you DM for *yourself*. Isn't that how it is with most games?   *I* wanna have fun and hangout tonight  *I'll* hangout with some friends.   Together we'll have fun  but *my* motivation is that *I* wanna hangout.   *I* wanna make a world and show it off.   *I* like rp.  Much like going to watch a movie at a cinema with friends  you can't really be an imposter  can you? Well unless you don't like to watch the movie  but you still say you do  then you're an imposter.  If you like to play  if you like the idea of doing it  and you enjoy or at least tolerate the need for prepping  **then you're in no way an imposter.**
2814,I feel like I need to drive an Aston Martin  just because it is the one brand I do not *get* at all.  I think their cars are aesthetically good  but nowhere near as good as the cars they're competing with. The interiors are usually pretty ugly. The performance is never that great. Reliability is awful and build quality is hit or miss. Even the brand name is sort of nebulous (at least in America) since most people here don't even know what an Aston is much less how much they cost.   What attracts people to this brand?
2815,Renault/Nissan are next to leave. They're even worse off than Honda.  F1 is a losing money pit. It takes billions of dollars in delveoping an engine which would be better spent on Electric vehicles and surviving Covid.
2816,"D&D is a great gateway experience  since most folks will be familiar with Tolkien and probably have read either LOTR or Hobbit.  Then you get to make believe in this world  or one very similar. And there are rules that make it fun  etc.  Where the D&D rules start to become too prevalent for their own good  in my opinion  is when people want to try different things that are a departure from the standard sword/sorcery fantasy heroics.  I got into Ravenloft's Gothic horror setting in a big way  and dived into it with plenty of my own homebrew stuff.  I quickly recognized that the D&D rules weren't that great of a fit for what I was trying to get the setting to do. I bought up almost every 3rd Edition book (including plenty of third-party unofficial rulebooks) searching for something to make it all function the way I wanted.  It wasn't until 2008 when they had just announced 4th Ed. (with a fair bit of trash talk about 3rd Ed. rules and those who followed them) that I finally had enough. I put all my unnecessary 3E stuff on ebay  and sat down and had a brutally honest ""wish list"" of the stuff I wanted from my gaming system.  And then I sat down in a gaming store in Connecticut for two days and went through every RPG game system on their shelves  measuring each system against the wish list in a truth table.  It eventually led me to GURPS - although TriStat-dX  HERO System  and Basic RolePlay were all strong finalists.  These days  I'll happily play other systems  but I'm most comfortable with GURPS and I tend to only GM in that system myself.  GURPS was flexible enough to run the following campaign concepts for me:  * Post-Collapse medieval tech  with higher tech stuff periodically reentering from orbit. Set in Western Africa in what used to be the country of Gabon. Sci-fi  apocalypse  multitech.  * Gothic dark fantasy and espionage  in my conversion of the Ravenloft setting. Low power levels  combat is dangerous and to be avoided  supernatural foes are a very real threat if combat occurs.  * A heroic squirrel saves her critter friends from a polluting threat to the forest - and also helps hold off the unkempt loud bipeds that keep chopping down trees."
2817,[Nightwings by Robert Silverberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwings_\(novella\)).  Some light fantasy buried under the science. A world dominated by guilds with people heavily modified for specific roles in the society.  [Land and Overland by Bob Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_and_Overland).  A feudal society in the midst of an energy crisis. Plenty of fantasy elements and interesting concepts without going heavy in the whole magic department.
2818,I'm going to rent a car this Saturday for a 2 day road trip. I'll be going through unfamiliar territory  and the route I'm taking is sort of complex  therefore I really want a car with android auto  so I don't have to bother fumbling with my phone to get directions while I drive. Two years ago when I last got a rental car  I chose the luxury car option  but they gave me a Toyota Avalon which did not even have a navigation system nor any kind of android auto or anything like that.  What are the chances they give me a car with android auto? None of the car rental companies have anything on their website regarding the technology their cars have. It seems that Android Auto is more standard these days than it was 2 years ago  but then again  it seems that a lot of low-end cars only have android auto as an option... Has anyone rented a car recently? Is android auto a feature that is only on the high end cars that you have to pay $200 a day for or something?
2819,I think so? Like I feel the voice direction changed after a while  so while Asta remains an obnoxious character  there isn't as much just screaming from him  and when it's used  I personally feel that it's used more effectively.   Either that or I don't notice it as much/have gotten used to it.

2822,I see a lot of articles talking about a 'Micron X100 SSD' that sits in a PCIe slot and reads/writes at 9GB/s with very low latency... however when I actually try to buy it  it's not for sale anywhere.  Does this product actually exist?
2823,I bought new PC for a good price  but case is compact. And not sure I could find a power supply that would fit and have enough connections. My vid card needs separate power. So could just rig up my old power supply and use that. Or would the 2 power supplies running cause bad stuff to start happening.l?
2824,I live in Boston  which is a biotech and biomedical research hub so there are lots of pharma/biotech companies hiring for data scientists  such as Biogen  Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Moderna. There are some digital health tech companies here as well.  For the biotech/pharma companies  many of the research science roles will likely require a PhD in the realm of biostatistics or bioinformatics. However  they do also hire for business data science positions where you don't need a PhD.
2825,If this is for winter wheels by any chance I would recommend 17 inch square setup with 225R17 45 tires.  Clublexus have some after market wheel threads for 3is  you could take inspirations from there.  I'm running 17inch enkei t6s in black on my IS. Enkei have some decent quality wheels while not being super expensive.

2827,"I am starting a DS masters program in a few weeks and I need a new computer.  I have more or less settled on the MacBook Pro 13""(although I am open to other suggestions) and I've been told 16GB of memory is highly recommended.  My question is should I get the lower end MacBook Pro 13"" and upgrade to 16GB memory or the more expensive one that comes with 16GB memory for $300 more?   In other words will the extra storage(512GB vs 256) and the CPU(2.0GHz quad-core vs 1.4GHz) be necessary/useful in the masters program and subsequent work environment?  Any insight is appreciated."
2828,[Newegg Insider blog post](https://www.newegg.com/insider/how-to-choose-graphics-card/)  [Here's a screenshot of the specs in question](https://i.imgur.com/zQIHgA1.png)  > Therefore we believe that the specifications listed by Newegg are pure speculation from a contributing writer
2829,Joel Grus gave a [good conference talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/preview?slide=id.g362da58057_0_1) (at JupyterCon no less) about notebooks a few years back  and much of what he said is still true. It does a good job of summarizing what many people don't like about notebooks.  I also found [this blog post](https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/08/27/coolest-things-jupytercon/) from that year that highlighted a few interesting things from the same conference  might be worth a read.  I find that for data exploration  jupyter notebooks are very helpful  but for reusable and testable code it makes sense to move to python modules as soon as you can.
2830,"Establish the other dealant as someone that can be somewhat trusted. Ask for nothing in return the first 1-2 times. Stuff like that. Have them keep their deals  maybe even allow the players to renege if they are totally unhappy with the result. Or just give a complete satisfaction guarantee. ""If you are not happy with how this deal turns out  you have no duty to me  i walk away  and you will never hear from me again. No bullshit tricks either.""  Or allow the players to design the deal themselves. Have the djinn ask them what they want and what they offer for it. Also have an out-of game ""no lawyering"" explanation stating that the exact wording used between players is the spirit of the deal  no stupid wordplay involved.  However  most genre-savvy players will only get involved with this kind of stuff if they actually want the drama in their game. Because they are not stupid  and have consumed enough media to know the tropes of double-dealing demons."
2831,This confuses me  a lot of news articles actually stated it would be 4K 120 FPS. Not 4K 60.... https://www.gamesradar.com/amp/black-ops-cold-war-120fps/  Maybe they meant 4K60 for campaign and 4K120 for Multiplayer/zombies?
2832,Sadly  as you say  even one Xenomorph (Genestealer) would slaughter them. I'd have a cult  set up by the Imperial Echlesiarchy representative that has perverted the imperial creed  and so they have destroyed the Astropathic choir (or what ever comms they have.) I would specifically have no obvious chaos involvement  but basically have them turn up in the Wickerman  where the locals don't want them there.
2833,The “1 on 1 Dungeon World... but better” option would probably be [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).  Ironsworn is  in all essence- like Dungeon World- a Powered by the Apocalypse game (a game in some way  shape  or form inspired by Apocalypse World). It is a Dark-ish/ Viking-ish Fantasy Game where play as Ironsworn  adventurers who literally live and die on their Iron Vows among the dangerous Ironlands.  Ironsworn deviates a little bit from more “traditional” PbtA games  but not all that much. When compared to DW  I think- being a more modern PbtA-esque game- Ironsworn has picked up a lot more “modern” PbtA sensibilities. Vanilla DW is *okay*  but hacks of DW (like Unlimited Dungeons or Chasing Adventure) provide a much needed face lift for DW. That in mind  my vote still goes towards Ironsworn for 1 on 1 play. Not to mention that if you want to eschew the 1 on 1 aspect and go straight up GM-less “Co-Op ” Ironsworn readily supports that style of play.  It’s a super fun and nicely focused game- especially thanks to the Iron Vow procedures that help guide play into focusing hard core on your Vows. It honestly feels like every mechanic is in there for a reason and everything sings really nicely together.  The PDF is completely free (criminally so  given how much content is in that game) and the Delve Supplement won’t break the bank and provides tons of extra content for Delving ancient depths and plenty of other supplemental rules  mechanics  and just tons more wonderful Oracular Tables.  Ironsworn is excellent for purely Solo Play as well. While it does involve the Solo Play aspect of Ironsworn  season 2 of [Me  Myself  and Die](https://youtu.be/zVxJ3exjfgI) is tightly edited and really shows off the game’s flow.  [Party of One](https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/game/tmp-y061niza45rwdps/) did some 1 on 1 Ironsworn.  [Ask the Oracle](https://ironsworn.podbean.com) is a Co-Op Podcast with the designer of the game.

2835,Ten Candles fits this perfectly. It's incredible at creating a really powerful atmosphere  and the ending is a gut punch every time.  Unfortunately it really requires an in-person game  which is a bit of an obstacle these days.
2836,I'm new to GM'ing  but I have had this idea  where I would cooperate with another GM  where each of our groups will be investigating some sort of time/space anomaly over the course of several sessions  perhaps months. Each time I've had a session  I tell the other GM how my group interacted with the anomaly  so they can incorporate it into their next session  and vice versa. After some time one of the groups would somehow break through the anomaly and the two groups would face each other. Ideally the two groups would be in the dark about the GMs conspiring until the big reveal.   I think it would be kinda cool to with Call of Cthulhu in different times  but perhaps it could actually be done with two different systems  say Traveller and DnD?  Depending on how the two groups react to each other  it could either turn into a paranoid bloodbath  where they face off in battle  or they could end up cooperating to solve the mystery of the anomaly and get things back to normal. Either way  it would probably be a lot of fun!
2837,Fuck epic and their shitty store that they couldn't get anyone to use till they gave gta away for free  And fuck Google and all their shitty data collecting apps and trackers.

2839,This won't stop pirates  probably won't even slow them down. All this will do is piss off legitimate consumers.   Companies need to realize that making the experience worse when implementing DRM just makes people angry and creates more pirates. Look at PC gaming  it should be the epitome of piracy  yet Valve is making so much bank off Steam because people like it  despite it being DRM. And yes I realize Steam isn't perfect  but I don't think many people would leave it even if they could take their library of games with them.
2840,In the wet driving driving normally I can say  - AWD dont need to alter your driving style (STI)  I dont notice loss of traction and just drive like i always do. - In the rain my FWD i need to be mindful of throttle postion even at normal speeds in the wet. Too much steering and too much throttle will cause slip  abs/traction control kicks in and its messy (1.6 GDi with twin scroll turbo). Off the lights  same mess  too much throttle and traction control rudley kicks in.   Tl dr in the rain  FWD sucks and AWD is fun.
2841,"I don't know about ""objective"" reasons  but Brotherhood is the faithful adaptation of the source material which makes it a more cohesive story. FMA has its merits for sure  but if you take someone else's story and come up with your own ending halfway through it's just not going to be as consistent as a story that was planned out start to end."
2842,"Stigmas and word of mouth.   I hated BMWs cause of the asshole drivers stigma when I was younger but instantly loved them after driving a 335i.  Also its so people can just have something to talk about and just go on about *""hyup  they don't make it like how they used to anymore""* and then drive off in their '67 chevelle and wingadinga down the block with their cronies."
2843, If you’re working within Data Science  You must be familiar with Pandas. Specifically designed to carry out Data preprocessing tasks  Pandas has a ton of functionalities that can make managing  cleaning  visualizing  and retrieving data extremely easy. And as anyone would know  A large chunk of a Data Scientists' time goes into **getting the data into a clean and understandable format for machine learning.**  I have written an entire article on how to get started with Pandas  Hopefully  you guys will like it :)   [https://medium.com/@moeedlodhi/7-pandas-functions-to-boost-your-productivity-c56f274de639](https://medium.com/@moeedlodhi/7-pandas-functions-to-boost-your-productivity-c56f274de639)
2844,"If you're talking about a department head (i.e.  the highest ranking DS person in the company)  then to me the answer boils down to one thing:  **They are able to secure resources and recognition for their team's work.**  How they get there is largely irrelevant. Maybe they're a really strong communicator with deep connections within the organization and know nothing about data science. Maybe they're really strong technically and have built a reputation as ""the smartest person in the room"". Maybe it's a mix of both. The point is that at the highest levels your goal isn't to *do*  but rather to *facilitate.*   If you're talking about a functional lead (i.e.  a middle manager)  then the answer is more complicated  because it depends largely on the team. Things I would look for:  1. **Knows how to take a problem statement and turn it into the** ***right*** **problem statement:** the biggest challenge for people as they go from IC to manager is that they're used to being given the problem they need to solve. When you become manager  you need to be able to push back on what looks like a reasonable problem statement at face value and transform it into the right problem statement. The one that will produce the right results. 2. **Has a solid enough understanding of the work that their team needs to do to establish a reasonable pace of work and push their direct reports to be as efficient as possible:** Managers with no technical background struggle with this because they often either ask for unreasonable timelines  or alternatively have their people spin their wheels for months solving the wrong problem/approaching the problem incorrectly. 3. **Has really strong project management skills:** No one likes to hear this  but when you become a manager your strongest asset is to keep projects on track. That's what the organization will ultimately measure you and your team on. 4. **Can both execute on the ""now""  but can also keep an eye ahead for opportunities and roadblocks:** This is what separates middle managers from those ready for the next level - if you can execute everything  you'll do fine as a middle manager. But to get to the next level you need to be able to do that while figuring out ""what else?"". What else can your team work on? What else should you be planning for? What else could go wrong? What else can you add to your technology stack."
2845,Cross die core to core latency suffers  a lot. This is important for a lot of HPC related tasks as well as gaming. You can see this in EPYC CPUs which have extremely high latency when you cross dies  to the point that going to main memory is almost as fast. The advantage is that you can scale up with multiple dies much further  which helps for things like web servers.
2846,"I listened to Manager Tools and thought to myself ""being a competent people manager is pretty straightforward "" and it was (being a great people manager is a different story). If you're a high performing IC and genuinely care about supporting your team  then you're probably going to be at least a competent people manager.   That said  despite reasonably good business outcomes and great people outcomes  I ended up going back to being an IC. For me  the experience was good and the lessons invaluable  but I realized I much more enjoyable it is to be an IC with a good boss than to be a good boss.    In your shoes  if you have good intentions and the drive to help your teammates succeed  I'd give it a shot. The odds that you'll positively impact your teammates are fairly good and it is excellent experience to have  regardless of if it is a long term fit."
2847,"Data scientist in the digital marketing industry here. For the most part  just knowing how to do some basic analysis and effectively present your findings will set you head and shoulders apart from most of your marketing peers.   Regarding learning data science: In my experience  most digital marketing firms that claim to be ""data driven"" are really just using the OOTB tools included in their web analytics or CRM platform and don't really have a rigorous approach to analysis outside these tools. While they do provide decent starting point  but I've found these type of tools to be a sledgehammer approach that tends to analyze your customer base at an aggregate level rather than incorporating varying degrees of customer heterogeneity. They also tend to be very black-box and appear to make predictions that wildly overfit small datasets (I'm looking at you SF Einstein Send-Time-Optimization)  By applying your own data science techniques  you'll automatically gain a much greater insight into the quality of your predictions. You'll be able to do things like see error metrics  test for statistical significance  and explore different model types. You will also have much greater flexibility in solving the various business problems clients approach you with.  At my organization  most of our data analysts have very little programming experience. We use Alteryx to enable them to pull  clean  transform  and run some cursory exploratory and predictive analysis on data without them having to write any code. It has a fairly hefty price tag  but it has enabled our lesser experienced analysts to be effective in data prep."
2848,"I guess I have two if that's fair  A McLaren F1 LM would be the ""holy shit I can't believe I own this"" car.  But realistically it'd be sweet to have a 2020 Carrera 4s with the aero kit  something I could actually use everyday and still appreciate."
2849,"Adding in my experience as my background is similar to yours. I'm currently a data scientist/""researcher"" at an F100 company (last job was a DS at an F50 Tech company) and a part-time Ph.D. candidate in a Cognitive Science in Education Program. Prior to entering my Ph.D. and the data science space  I have 2 years of FT work and a graduate degree in instructional systems.  My opinion is that your unique social science background is very valuable depending on the area. My own career started in Ed-Tech and then transitioned into Human Capital/People Analytics  with the latter becoming ever more popular and needed as companies realize the value of Data in HR.

2850,No. You say 2-4 people but neglect to mention whether they're all even using the same system or have the same general network accessibility.  Could 2-4 people do what you describe? Yes  but they'd have to all be experts in their respective fields  not dabblers. Their content would be sub-par but probably passable if they're using tools like Substance's Alchemist or so on - barring that they have access to an exceptional tooling programmer that can automate damn near everything to hide it from the other idiots.  Hobby environments are pure chaos. In real environments we can create system processes to watch folders and mutate results as fast as they're made.
2851,D&D is like the Monopoly of TTRPGs - everyone has played it  people outside the space know of it and think that's all there is to the space  meanwhile you have a lot of great indie darlings that do so much more with the genre than this Hasbro-acquired big name brand.
2852,Small quibble: Price-perf numbers make *no* sense in terms of actual retail pricing today. I know we are comparing cards at release  and that at founders edition MSRP (rather than the higher retail price of cards you can actually get) but people looking for the best purchase *today* should just ignore that column.    Great work all around  though.
2853,Give it a few weeks  they will be back.  It is how these “respond to rage” gimmicks work.  Keep holding them accountable people.  Stop giving them your money would help too  but it looks like far to many have done that already...
2854,This is a better question for r/ProjectCar.  It all depends on the chassis type and material you intend to use.  Most homemade chassis's don't use many 3D printed or CNC components. It's just steel tubing and sheet metal to make a frame than they'll use Fiberglass for the body. You would only use CNC for odd brackets here and there  assuming you couldn't make them from sheet metal.  3D printing and CNC work is mostly for custom engine components  at least from what I've seen. Papadakis Racing flushing 3D printed Aluminum for an intake. I've also seen CNC's used for custom wheels.  But generally there's no reason to make a car completely from scratch. Usually people will take chassis bits from existing cars and piece them together to make something new (front end of a 280z  rear of a Mustang  etc). This is a lot cheaper than trying to make custom components that won't work as well. And even this route still requires a lot of fabrication and bits from a 3D printer or CNC.
2855,Honestly I think it's no more disruptive than people pushing mention of their pet system into every single thread  even where it clearly doesn't belong.  Maybe I wouldn't find it as annoying if it wasn't always the same three games...
2856,Not talking about 12k new mitsubishis  we know what we’re getting for that. What are so extremely disappointing cars with terrible build quality?  I’ve got to say  back when the g35 was new  it had Nissan plastics with questionable leather and an engine that would quit after 120k miles (didn’t creak or rattle which was a positive). When comparing to the German and Japanese Competitors at the time  it must have felt like a joke.   Neon srt 4 is another onE that comes to mind  but at least the price was reasonable and people kind of knew you were getting a Neon.
2857,I'm not sure I understand what the goal is here  and anytime you're interfacing directly with low-level graphics card API or drivers it tends to be platform or implementation specific as opposed to platform or implementation agnostic as you requested.   Since you are the one who is loading textures and meshes you should  already know the most about how much memory they're using on the video card. Yes there are some differences here or there but for the most part what you see is what you get.   It's been quite a few years since I dipped my toes into open GL or any other rendering API but from what I remember they serve as a platform independent middleware layer so you don't have to care about what the graphics card is doing. As soon as you start caring what the graphics card is doing you'll need to talk directly to it and not indirectly to it via DirectX OpenGL or similar.
2858,Argh  the problem is I can find a better deal much quicker for the disc version of new games. And not to mention I could literally hold the games and collect & display the box. Though if I lose the disc then I'm fucked.  But the digital version is a lot more convenient to use in the long run and mostly only good for buying older games. Man  selling digital version at a full-priced box version should be illegal  just a $10 price slice and I would go all-digital without a question. Man....Decision-decision.
2859,Any game where you fight to preserve the status quo.  So most military games  espionage games  etc. Anything where you serve the established power structure and disruption of that is the typical threat.
2860,You put a lot of thought into this. I’ve been a car journalist from 2006 - 2017. I have three points of feedback that might help you.   1) Try not to talk about everything. A good review/story is about the things that really need mentioning. You don’t have to talk about every button or detail. That way it becomes too much of a spec sheet. Zoom in on the features and details that really matter on the particular car. When writing about a Prius  potential buyers want to know how the hybrid system works. Choose your battles  so to speak. When I first started  the editor in chief always had to shorten my reviews because I just kept writing and writing and writing.   2) Try to view and review the car from the perspective of the potential buyers. So try to stay away from statements that are too personal. Like saying the overal styling is very grandma: the Prius (at least here in Holland) appeals to an older crowd. Don’t insult them. Always try to stay relevant. Certainly don’t try to be “too funny”  like with the bit about tampon on wheels. You’re not Jeremy Clarkson and you shouldn’t try to be. Especially not early in your career.   3) Make sure that everything you say is indeed correct. Because car fanatics will rip you apart. Like the bit with the spoiler. It’s not there for speed  it’s there to optimise the streamline of the car  which is very important. A hybrid needs a low CW value to be extra fuel efficient.  Just go out there and drive  drive  drive as much as possible. The more experience you get  the better. Testing different cars also adds to your perspective and gives you a broader reference.   Keep it up  you obviously have the the passion for it  so this is a great start!
2861,I think one of the determining factors is where your data science team is in its growth cycle. If you're in a data first company  with plenty of deployed models that need periodic updates and have defined business questions  then Scrum can be a great option.  That said  very few companies are in that stage of their development.   Personally my biggest concerns with scrum is lack of free form time that can be used to innovate and explore  as well as the burnout that can come from an overly aggressive sprint schedule - not sustainable for the amount of mental bandwidth data science requires.   Personally  I pick and choose components from Scrum to manage my data science teams and its worked well  but all scrum all the time would be disastrous IMO.

2863,"I'm not sure anyone would look at your web app tbh. When you say ""in the past year "" how much was before covid vs. during covid? I ask just because I think things have gotten a lot more competitive during this time  when lots of companies are tightening belts and enacting hiring freezes and others are laying people off. There are just a lot of experienced  recently laid off competing for a small number of jobs at the companies that are still hiring  so FAANGs are going to be able to pass over people that are probably amply qualified  but don't have as much experience as the other candidates they're competing against. I think apply to some smaller companies too."

2865,I enjoyed this.  The cinematography and the Miura's engine noise was pure automotive porn.   Like some of the YouTube comments said  I think the audio balance with Hyphen's narration vs the music was a little muddy  and  when coupled with his quiet  thoughtful timbre  he kind of got lost in the mix a bit.  But the script was good  and I liked the story he told.  &nbsp   This is a good start for Cammisa-less ISSIMI channel content and I think the bones of a great series of videos are here  considering the caliber of cars that regularly make their way through ISSIMI.  Give him some time and I think Hyphen will really come into his own with these.
2866,Hey. Currently I am thinking about applying 3D graphics program in Futuregames because I want to be 3D artist in game industry. Its a rigid career change for my part  considering I have graduated from Computer Science program and not Fine Arts. But thats what I want to do and I decided to do. But I have a few questions about it.   - How competitive is it to get accepted in this program? Considering my background is irrelevant. I know I have to compete with people who studied fine arts their whole life. I enjoy creating art  I have a decent portfolio as well  but prolly good Fine Art grads would beat me in that area  - How many international students apply/how many are accepted?   - Does Futuregames currently accepting international students? Due to Coronavirus etc
2867,I'll add in /r/IKRPG or the Iron Kingdoms RPG  which is the rpg of the mini game WarMachine and Hordes. You can nearly translate the rules from one to the other  so if you've played the mini game  it's pretty easy to get into the rpg  and vice versa. The miniatures are all used in the rpg as well  if you want.
2868,I'm in political science  and I find R to be incredibly useful compared with Excel. I first jumped from Excel to Stata  which I still use sometimes when the statistical models (mixed models  for example) are better executed there  however  for data cleaning and other tasks like visualization  R is straightforwardly superior. I have dipped a toe in Python using Pandas  but I find R to be better for data cleaning. There is definitely a hurdle to overcome  but the returns will come quickly  and you'll be able to do many tasks more efficiently after a few months. I strongly recommend using R Studio (a comfy shell for R) and focusing on learning the tidyverse (especially dplyr).
2869,I know it is a long shot but  what will nvidia produce with all 7nm that they have booked for next year. Server ampere gpu's are 7nm but there will be more 7nm production than they need for server gpu's. Just imagine around august a full super or ti series on 7nm to challenge before the rdna3. AMD supposed to move one gen per year. Nvidia does this every 2 years with traditional midterm refresh.   Do not come to hard on me  just thinking out loud not claiming anything.
2870,Bad crunch  RIFTS. Just an overwhelming number of pointless rules that makes the game nearly unplayable for me.  Good crunch  Burning Wheel. Its core mechanic is simple  and the addon mechanics flesh out specific parts of the game and add a lot of depth that still has the core of the game firmly in mind.
2871,Let me start by saying I'm relatively new to ECS (or Data Oriented Design aka DOD) too. But I would like to share my approach as I've seen this problem a couple of times by now. I actually think this problem fits DOD better than OOP in my opinion  but I'll leave that rant out of here.  My design would be the following:  __SpellCasterComponent:__ * Holds if this entity wants to cast a spell. * Holds which spell to cast? This can be a simple ID for a database/map lookup. This has the advantage that this ID can also used to lookup UI text/textures or other data all spells have in a database. Alternatively  a reference to a prefab will do but more on this later. * Potentially holds more data on if the entity can cast a spell such as mana or something.  __SpellCasterSystem:__ Responsible for going over all SpellCasterComponents. If a component wants to cast a spell  we do so by spawning a prefab (either from a database lookup or using a stored reference directly). Added to this newly spawned entity/prefab is a SpellComponent  more about this later. The important thing to note here is that this system does not care about what spell is being casted. The behavior of each spell becomes the data here in the from of a prefab.  __SpellComponent:__ * Holds a reference to who cast this spell. This allows spells to affect different characters based on who cast the spell. You probably want your fire ball spell to ignore collision with its caster. * Potentially other general data needed for all spells such as the energy put into this spell.  Now each spell prefab holds components that execute it's behavior once spawned into the world. * A FireBallSpellPrefab might have a MoveForwardComponent  a 3DModelComponent and a CollisionComponent. * A HealingSpellPrefab might have a ParticleComponent  AnimationComponent and a  HealingRangeComponent.  Because spells are just prefabs  it's easy to add a new one. Any weird data can be queried for through components. For example a JumpCounterComponent that counts how many times the player jumps  or a FreezeSpellDataComponent for those 10 weird variables used to calculate freeze damage. And this way you don't end up with any useless data or dependencies between spells.  Regarding status effects  I think it's best to create a StatusEffectComponent that holds a flag/bitfield with all the status effects active on this entity. You probably won't have 100's of status effects  and I doubt each status effect will hold specific data not shared by other status effects. It's not a bad thing to have potentially many systems access this component. Most systems will only read from it and so can do this in parallel.  Hope this helps a bit  and if anyone has any better ideas I'd love to hear it :)

2873,I really want to see these 30 watt GPU's paired with 25 watt CPUs die off. Just put something like a 4700hs in there instead. These are pretty much used to just sell laptops by putting an nvidia sticker on them and letting kids believe that they are gaming laptops.
2874,Lowering springs or coilovers are the only proper way of doing things  a good set of springs should cost around 2-300 USD and shouldn't affect the driving that much. You can always just add weight but that's going to feel way worst than just lowering springs.
2875,For any 40k RPG (to make it relevant to sub) and on the table top  I love Black Templar’s. The 40k setting can have the interesting back story sure  but its literally more about the rip and tear from your position  whether guard or Astartes. Honestly  saying ‘as a young boy I was selected to be an Astartes  I survived the processes  fought the hoards of chaos as a neophyte  and as an initiate I will become a sword brother through battle’ is enough back story to motivate anyone in any scenario. I love the Salamanders for the same reasons you gave  but a lot of chapters have their niche  just like the guard
2876,Since gamers are moving into digital media while physical is getting left behind  I would push for GameStop to turn into the PC market. PC is getting bigger and it would be nice to have a store nearby with some components instead of almost going online for them.
2877,Hey folks!  I'm currently running a Legend of Zelda themed campaign using the Reclaim the Wild system.  I'll leave a link down below (really cool btw  plus they just made some updates!).  [https://reclaimthewild.net/](https://reclaimthewild.net/)  On to the topic of this post  my players are about to discover Zora's Domain (not its name in my world  but whatever).  I'm basing my Zora people on those found in BOTW.  I'm asking for any cool or interesting fish or water-creatures from real life that can be transformed into cool fish-boy/girl characters.  An example would be something like Muzu from BOTW  a Zora whose appearance resembles a ray of some sort.  Any and all ideas are welcome.  Thanks!
2878,"> **How do you guys interact with software engineers on the job?**   Nicely.  What you describe is true at a lot of companies - even at companies that have a more mature process like what u/ramblingsteve is describing (with projects/budgets/allocation of resources)  you still have this issue when something unexpected happens. Like  your server went down and now someone needs to restore the last version of the DB - something that will take about a full day for someone to go through (I'm making this example up  and this is not how long all DB restores takes  but let's just roll with it).  The answer to your question is in your post itself:  1. Don't act like they owe you something. 2. Don't ""give them tasks""  I could write an essay on this  but I will keep it simple: your goal should be to build a solid relationships with software. And that means that instead of demanding things and getting mad when you don't get them  you should focus on forming a team with your development counterpart and be willing to give and take  and to understand.  The most common mistake I see people make is determining what *they* thing the solution is and then demanding the solution they thought of - that is in contrast to engaging your development counterpart so that you can both jointly decide a) what the real problem is  and b) what the best solution is given time constraints.  The second mistake I see people make is that  when development can't help them meet a deadline  they blame development. That is  you needed something done by tomorrow afternoon and development cannot do that. So you sit there and go ""those a-holes are the reason why I missed this deadline"". No. The reason you missed your deadline is because you didn't plan properly. Development could have maybe bailed you after you made whatever mistake you made  but they weren't able to. That is not their fault. Again  you are one of maybe dozens or hundreds of people who are asking them to do stuff.   Again  in short - focus on building relationships. Focus on understanding how they operate  what constraints they have  etc."
2879,"After decades of weekly games set at recurring times  my latest West Marches style game gets set up and organized by the players.    My schedule is wide open  so I only ask for a 24 hour heads up  but beyond that a player decided that they want to ""go on an adventure"" and puts a 4 to 6 person party together out of the dozen or so players available.   Sometimes it's twice a week  sometimes it's once every two weeks  depends on people's schedues.  I've noticed that  especially with an entirely online game  it seems like there's less distraction and people half participating while they're doing something else."
2880,Hellsing was made before the series ended so they had to make up and ending. I believe that most people think it's just worse than the actual ending. Ultimate is more faithful and had much better animation. You do not need to see both  but if you want to there's no reason not to. If you only watch one I highly suggest ultimate.
2881,I don't care about the length of the loan  so long as the price and interest rate are right.  Give me a 30 year loan if the interest rate is less than inflation and its a fair price.  That is assuming it's a vehicle I would actually want to carry full coverage insurance on indefinitely.  When the value falls below about 10k  I'd pay it off and drop collision.
2882,no shit.  Didn't need consumer reports to tell us that.  For commuting EV is perfect.  no idling  quite  efficient  enough range (for majority).   Price is a bit steep still if you want one with decent range  but that will come down with time (3\~5 years imo)
2883,I was one of the GM's at ***Horror-Con 4***  Thursday Night to Sunday mid-morning - about 63 hours or so of ***Champions 4th Edition*** with no sleep  fueled by lots and lots of caffeine... Was an epic session...  &#x200B   Played a lot of DnD in the Military Friday nights to Monday Morning.  So  similar amounts of time. over many  many months/years. :)
2884,Same here.  I just don't enjoy high fantasy  so I don't make those worlds.  If something fantastical happens  it's because it's either magic-powered science (or science-powered magic) or is so weird that every religion has a different story and there's a dozen conspiracy theories floating around and some people just refuse to believe it.  All I have to do is keep the actual facts straight as they were witnessed by my party.  Which is already a job that requires heavy lifting because their memories get a bit fuzzy and confuse demons with devils  rival faction alliances and antagonists  blights and ooze  etc.  And then my own memory gets fuzzy.  Honestly  we're all a tiny bit confused at all times.
2885,Data scientists that have worked on projects in the field of Industry 4.0: Share here your experiences with me!  Hello people  I'm a recent grad student applying for an internship position at a startup which provides consultancy and implementantion of projects in the realm of Data science/ machine learning/ AI for factories and other industrial facilities. I would like to know from more experienced professionals what are the main challenges regarding Data in this field.

Could you give me some examples of projects in this field you have worked on?  Thanks in advance  folks!
2886,Attainable - C8 Corvette Z51 Convertible - I love convertibles and V8 and this is a fantastic deal on a midship engine car that can also be enjoyed because maintenance and parts are not crazy expensive. A dream car should be enjoyed  not rot in a garage. Only down side on it is that it doesnt come with a manual.     Crazy - Caterham 420S SV - Great fun  but not practical as a daily. I am not a good enough driver for the 620S which tries to kill you even more than the 420 does. I have seriously considered buying one as a daily  but I think my wife would not be fond of it.     Classic - Ferrari 365GTS/4 Daytona. I love the Miura's looks  but I would never fit in one and its handling at speed is questionable. The Daytona was as fast as the Miura  but with benign handling and also available as Convertible.
2887,"As someone actually playing the game right now  my advice would be : ""neither"".  My group has started playing in DFRPG  then got annoyed at how broken the system was  tried switching over to DFA  in the process immediately noticed that the game is also very broken  and have now settled to simply playing with basic Fate Accelerated. It works a lot better.  My order of systems to run Dresden files in is thus FAE > DFA > DFRPG.  However  the DFRPG book may indeed help with worldbuilding and thinking about characters simply by giving you a bunch more options to consider. Similarly  the 2nd DFRPG book may give you a good insight in what kind of stuff is hanging out in the world of Dresden Files. But since you are already very familiar with the world  i would highly suggest just playing in Fate Accelerated.  If you want a rant on what is absolutely broken in DFRPG or DFA  i can deliver that  too."
2888,"Seems like people are telling you all the same things but not spelling it out. Obviously I don't know what the actual interviewer meant when says ""not enough product experience"" but I believe it's an attempt to convey a couple of things about your interview  1. Sounds like your academic background is good and theoretical knowledge is solid/good enough. 2. Your answers to questions probably are too academic when posed with hypothetical problems. You have to think more tactically in industry and really figure out how to do the least amount of work for the maximum return. Problems posed aren't meant for a lengthy study  it's patch and move on. 3. Product also means shifting perspective to the end user. Wipe the slate and start thinking what are they trying to solve and how does this product do that? no more  no less. Think unipurpose kitchen tool. Also think  how can this fail? what does failure look like? what's the minimum viable product need to have for anyone to get benefit. 4. Product also means timeframes. While I hate prospective estimation of time to complete research  that's what industry does. If someone says how long would you need to do something it should be short  or you say a reasonable time with a deliverable A  B  C timeframe. People in industry get frustrated when people from academia want to have absolute truth through experimentation because in reality  businesses take risks  make assumptions and fix problems while in production. Think what's ""good enough"" for each thing and it's ok to say this has maybe a probability of X to Y.   Obviously you are frustrated but honestly you are doing great. Getting those interviews are an accomplishment in itself and you'll be better at each consecutive one.  Good luck!"
2889,Sounds painful  don't expect to make them experts. Just train them to do simple repetitive tasks. They can always build their skillsets from there.

2893,you wouldn't believe how many people with this kind of learning are incapable of even applying high school levels math to real world business problems. PhDs in particular.  companies in general have very low expectations of new people  the good news is if you smash through all this stuff you get put on bigger and better things very quickly.
2894,Hi  I make a game called [The Elf Game](https://www.osrelfgame.com/store) that has a single page of rules  which were specifically designed to be understandable by people who have a hard time reading  such as people for whom English is a Second Language  Children  and Developmentally Disabled people. The game itself is about whatever you want it to be about  but what we recommend for beginners is to just build a few Characters and play through their lives for a day  and see how things develop.  The Elf Game is meant to be played by two or more people  so Duet campaigns are not only simple  but encouraged. It was made during this Pandemic  after all.  However  reading through your replies  it looks as though you're looking for places to play games *with* people  not just the game itself. The community is small  but we did just make a subreddit for our game and Blog  at /r/elfgame where I would encourage you  if you find you like the game  to make a Looking for Group post.
2895,">I’ll write a few lines of code but then stop and think “I’m not doing this right” or I’ll run into errors and lose all my confidence and shut down  >A lot of times I’ll write something that works but then wonder if theres more efficient or optimized ways to do it and come to the conclusion that my code is crap and worthless even though it runs fine  This hits home.  I'm a horrific perfectionist and fear of writing bad code kept me from writing *any* of my own code for almost two years.  Now I'm actually making progress and it's because of two rules that I tell myself over and over every day.  1. *The only way I can write good code is by writing shitty code that works and then rewriting it.*   The time it takes me to turn shitty code into good code is about 1/10th the time it takes me to write good code from scratch. I literally name my classes *""ShittyClassName""* to remind myself that it's okay that it's shitty and that I plan on rewriting it.   2. *Nothing needs to be optimized until it actually starts causing a problem.*    No more wasting time worrying hypothetical frame rate loss.

2896,A coworker and I are having a debate on the term All Wheel Drive. He has a Hyundai Santa Fe with a Lock button. This button puts the car in a mode where all four wheels are spinning at the same speed. Mostly for low speeds on rough terrain  or if you're stuck. It will only do this under 30km/h.  One of us says that means it's turning off the AWD system. The logic is that AWD specifically refers to the cars ability to intelligently send power to wheels that need it. When the Lock button is pressed  it's just spinning all four wheels at the same speed without traction or stability control  so the AWD system is off. They add that they have been told by multiple mechanics that this is the case.  The other says AWD refers generally to the fact that all four wheels are capable of being powered  therefore the AWD system is still on when the Lock button is pressed  it's just in a different mode.  They would like me to add that we're especially looking for the opinion of a mechanic.  EDIT: Thanks for the responses. If it wasn't clear  I'm the second person. I had him read through what I wrote to make sure it was a fair description of his argument. He read through the comments and... he says he'll have to agree to disagree.
2897,Here's how I would fix it....  step 1) Uninstall Chrome  step 2) Install Firefox or just use the new Edge which is just a better version of Chrome.

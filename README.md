# ECSE-551: Applied Machine Learning

### ‚Ä¢ Project 1: 
Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier (from scratch), K-Fold Validation, and Feature Engineering Pipeline in Python. Achieved accuracies of 93% & 80% on 2 distinct test sets
### ‚Ä¢ Project 2: 
Implemented a Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes‚Äô classifier (from scratch) with Binary Feature Encoding, TFIDF Normalization, and ùëøùüê Feature Selection in Python for Reddit Posts Classification. Achieved a 91.7% accuracy in the Kaggle competition
### ‚Ä¢ Project 3: 
Implemented a VGG-16 Convolution Neural Network (from scratch) with Image Augmentation, Pixel Normalization, and Dropout Regularization in Pytorch for a customized MNIST Fashion Dataset. Achieved a 96% accuracy in the Kaggle competition
